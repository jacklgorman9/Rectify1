At the root of our current political and cultural turmoil lies an unprecedented divisiveness. With all-or-nothing thinking fueled by tribalism, the result is a complete communication breakdown. And a predilection to convince rather than a willingness to listen and ultimately understand.Unhealthy and isolating, it's leaving us lonelier and angrier than ever.But more than anything, it's fracturing our humanity.So what do we do?Tom Scott says we need to talk about it.A graduate of Brown University with a Masters of Divinity from Yale, Tom is the founder of The Nantucket Project – an intimate ideas festival in the vein of TED — that brings together incredible leaders across a wide range of disciplines to talk story, with an eye on creating a better world.When the pandemic shuttered what would have been the 10th iteration of TNP, Tom decided to take his skills and curiosity on the road. Driven by a desire to engage with Americans first-hand, he enlisted his film crew on a slow route down the Mississippi River from Minneapolis to New Orleans, stopping in small towns daily to host get togethers with a wide variety of everyday people, chronicling difficult and at times painful discussions on politics, racism, and everything in between.What he discovered might surprise you.Returning for his second appearance on the podcast (catch RRP #360 if you missed it), today’s exchange with Tom begins with an honest acknowledgment of where culture currently sits. We discuss our fears and hopes for the future. And our shared concerns about the effects of quarantine on our kids and youth across the world.We shift gears to discuss The Neighborhood Project, an intentional conversation platform Tom and his team are creating for people to digitally gather, intentionally connect and share experience.Weaving clips into the edit lifted from his adventure down the Mississippi, Tom relates his effort to cultivate tactile, analog understanding between people who disagree. The wins. The losses. The glimmers of hope. And the challenges that remain.All told, Tom paints the picture of an imperfect America. But one that looks quite different from the highlight reel delivered by our respective social media feeds.Boots on the ground isn't twitter. And meaningful conversation matters. Therein lies promise.As someone I have known since 7th grade, my friendship with Tom runs deep. This conversation further cemented my admiration for this human.The visually inclined can watch our exchange on YouTube. And as always, the podcast streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.My aspiration is that you take this one on with a full heart and an open mind -- then find a way to better connect with your neighbor.Peace + Plants,Listen, Watch & SubscribeApple Podcasts | YouTube | Spotify | Stitcher | Google PodcastsThanks to this week’s sponsorsJoovv: Enhance your health, recovery, and sleep with Joovv light therapy.

Although many are toxic, less than 1% have been tested for human safety. Nonetheless, great quantities can still be found in our drinking water.How is this possible? Shouldn’t clean water be a fundamental right? These questions are both fair and important. Unfortunately, trusted regulatory bodies like the EPA often fail to adequately protect us. Science is often manipulated by companies that put profit over public health. And thus, industry pollution continues unsupervised -- and the consumer protection laws we do have in place remain unenforced.To better understand this reality -- how we got here and where to go from here -- I sat down with one of the most famous names in environmental activism.Meet the the singular and eminent Erin Brockovich.Best known as the legal file clerk who battled PG&E over polluted water in the town of Hinckley, CA, Ms. Brockovich was instrumental in architecting a case that resulted in the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in U.S. history.It’s a story that ended up on the big screen. Garnered Julia Roberts an Oscar for her portrayal of Erin under the direction of the great Steven Soderberg. And turned the name Erin Brockovich into not only a household name, but a verb.Unfortunately, America’s waters didn’t cease to be polluted after the closing credits of the film. In fact, they’ve only gotten worse -- a fact that should leave us all deeply concerned. And highly motivated to act.Because Superman's not coming.Today Erin delivers a master class on water, with one resounding takeaway: the problem is our's to solve.Simply put, we cannot rely on corporations or the government to protect us. An admittedly disheartening realization, it's also empowering -- a call to citizen activism to forge the better world we deserve.It's a theme Ms. Brockovich explores in her new book, Superman's Not Coming (and recently launched podcast of the same name), which both take a brutally honest look at how mismanagement, chemical spills, mishandling of toxic waste and sludge, and even fake studies have created the perfect storm in terms of damaging water systems in the United States. The result is making us sick. And destroying the environment along the way.This is a conversation about the outdated policies that perpetuate this pollution cycle, and the evil-overlord-level of deception that is happening in the corporations and government bodies we blindly trust.We discuss the regulatory landscape of clean water. How what most consider a human right has become politicized and weaponized. How to better educate yourself about your own water supply. And the actions to undertake in the event of an issue.In addition, we explore Erin’s upbringing. Her struggles with dyslexia. The experiences and mentors that fuel her perseverance. The case that brought her fame. And the vital work she has done since.Brimming with unexpected optimism, I think you will find Erin’s message a welcome break from the relentless apocalyptic doom presented by the 24-hour news cycle.A mighty, whip-smart and imposing force of nature, for many years I've deeply admired and respected Ms. Brockovich from afar. This conversation was an honor. And a powerful reminder of the indelible influence of the individual to create positive change and awaken a movement. The visually inclined can watch our exchange on YouTube.

A Conversation with Tristan HarrisScribd: A Call to Minimize Distraction & Respect Users' Attention by Tristan HarrisNon-profit: Center For Humane TechnologyYouTube: Who owns your data? Jaron Lanier has the answer. | Andrew YangTAs 2020 continues to unfurl in a fashion beyond surreal, more and more are descending into the anguished abyss of distress. Awakening to acrid tangerine skies that have transformed sunny California into a Blade Runner dystopia, I myself vacillate between melancholia and a commitment to forge a better world.When the darkness descends, I find sanity in focusing only on those things I can control: my actions and reactions. Nonetheless, waves of anxiety -- and sometimes even despair -- continue to break on the shores of my consciousness. It is in these moments that I resort to a battery of simple but generally quite effective contrary actions. I spend time in nature. Double down on meditation and human connection. I eat better and move more. And I extend myself in service to others.To further explore the many practical and unexacting things we can all undertake during this stressful time to course-correct our emotional disposition, reframe our reality and sustainably serve our well-being, I'm joined by my friend Rangan Chatterjee, M.D. -- who today returns for a third spin on the RRP flywheel.One of the most influential doctors in the U.K., Rangan is a pioneer in the field of progressive, functional medicine. He is double board-certified in internal medicine and family medicine, holds an honors degree in immunology, and has appeared on seemingly every prominent media outlet from the BBC to The New York Times. In addition, Rangan prevails over the wildly popular Feel Better, Live More podcast. His TEDx talk, How To Make Diseases Disappear, has been viewed almost 3 million times. And he is the author of three #1 Sunday Times bestselling books. The focus of today's conversation is his latest well-being tome, Feel Better In 5.A close cousin to my podcast with Atomic Habits author James Clear (RRP #401), today's exchange is all about habit change and habit formation. It's about the power of bite-sized actions. And how, when undertaken regularly, short and simple practices can rapidly and completely change your health and life.We discuss the difference between breaking bad habits versus crowding them out with new, better habits.We explore the realities of food addiction. Our epidemic of emotional eating. And Rangan's personal theory on cause and solution.We talk generally about holistic health and lifestyle medicine, and why progressive wellness should be accessible to all -- now more than ever.Interspersed throughout, Rangan shares how he has helped patients relieve stress, find fulfillment, and engender peace in these chaotic times.But most importantly, we explore his very simple, almost effortless, methods for building a new and sustainable lifestyle to serve our long-term health.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube (courtesy of Zoom). And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I always enjoy time spent with Rangan, even when it's remote. My hope is that you do as well -- and put his advice into action.Peace + Plants,Listen, Watch & SubscribeApple Podcasts | YouTube | Spotify | Stitcher | Google PodcastsThanks to this week’s sponsorsFour Sigmatic: Nutritious and delicious mushroom brews and elixirs made with only the highest quality adaptogens and easy to take on the go.

Today we extend this exploration with a former monk -- a renounced renunciant who returned to relate the wisdom gleaned for the betterment of all.Meet Jay Shetty.If that name rings a bell, it's likely due to his social media omnipresence. With a global following in excess of 20 million people, Jay has a knack for creating what he calls viral wisdom -- snackable videos based on ancient tenets that have surpassed 7 billion views -- making him one of the most viewed people on the internet.A graduate of Cass Business school with an honors degree in Behavioral Science, Jay has been named one of Forbes magazine’s 30-under-30. He's been invited to keynote at companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. He is the host of the popular On Purpose podcast. And the occasion for today’s conversation is Jay’s new book, Think Like A Monk --- a distillation of the timeless wisdom learned during his ascetic days on an ashram into practical tools we can all use to live a less anxious, more meaningful life.Today the man Russell Brand (RRP 448) calls 'a cat-eyed mystic' shares his story.This is a conversation about Jay's most unusual journey. His decision to shirk the predictable post-college path and instead move to India. The three-year exploration of austerity that indelibly changed his worldview. His decision to return home, fueled by a desire to make an impact. And the most remarkable path that followed.We discuss the insights he gleaned along the way -- and the many tools freely available to underscore our lives with greater meaning and purpose.Among many other subjects, we explore the plausibility of conscious capitalism. The double-edged sword of social media. And how to use commerce and attention for good. To spread love. Encourage laughter. And arouse souls from the waking dream that defines the lives of far too many.Note: This was taped pre-pandemic over 6 months ago, when the world was a very different place. Coronavirus delayed the original release of Jay’s book from Spring to Fall, so I agreed to hold on publishing this episode until now.You can watch it all go down (in my original home studio) on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.This conversation is more than just whimsical ramblings. Jay’s methods for mindfulness and self-actualization are evidence-based and platitude-free. Just perceptions and practical takeaways you can adopt right now that will positively reconfigure your reality.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Listen, Watch & SubscribeApple Podcasts | YouTube | Spotify | Stitcher | Google PodcastsThanks to this week’s sponsorsNative: Safe, effective protection against odor & wetness.

Much like this show, they explore topics like meditation, ego, vulnerability, kindneAs a reminder that we are spiritual beings inhabiting a material world -- wandering this rotating orb as it hurls across the multiverse — it's time to once again transcend the mortal coil to connect with all things ethereal.Our guide for today's celestial adventure is the candescent Radhanath Swami.A New York Times best-selling author, monk, philanthropist, activist and teacher, his Holiness Radhanath Swami is a man that radiates love, compassion and grace with a sweet and joyous disposition that has immeasurably impacted millions of souls across the world.Born Richard Slavin to middle-class parents in Chicago, he came of age amidst the strife and upheaval of the 1960s. A social activist, he slowly became disillusioned with the structural mandates of the western civilized way of life. So, still in his late teens, he left Chicago behind in search of greater meaning. After hitchhiking across the world, he felt called to India. There he met his spiritual teacher, catalyzing his transformation into the mystic he is today.Along the way, Radhanath Swami has founded multiple spiritual communities throughout the world, the most prominent of which is the Radha-Gopinath Ashram located in Mumbai, India. Under his inspiration and guidance, the project has grown to include hospitals, orphanages, a UN-awarded eco-friendly farm, schools, temples, emergency relief programs, and a food distribution program that feeds more than 300,000 children in India every single day. In addition, he teaches Eastern philosophy and spiritually throughout Europe, Asia, and America. His wisdom has reached over 100,000,000 views on social media in the last year. He has been featured as a guest speaker at Oxford, Cambridge, Princeton, Harvard, Columbia and Stanford, and at corporations such as HSBC, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Intel and Oracle. Along the way he has met with many a world leader, including Barak Obama and former Prime ministers Tony Blair, David Cameron and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Today he shares his story.This conversation is fueled by my concern for cultural cohesion -- a desire to help mend the vitriolic division and existential tension that is tearing us apart.Therefore, beyond exploring Radhanath Swami's story of origin, we spend the gravamen of our exchange examining what he calls 'the light'. It's about how to embody the space within ourselves that brims with compassion and empathy -- and why a committed spiritual practice is more important now than ever.I understand that some may recoil when it comes to topics spiritual. But this is not about religion. And it's not about dogma. Simply put, it's about why love is the answer.So look past the robe. Set aside preconceived opinions. Open your heart a crack. And be present to receive what this evolved human has to share. If you do, I think this powerful conversation will leave you feeling nourished, more hopeful and immensely more positive about our global predicament. Today's mind meld is viewable (via Zoom) on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Final Note: I intended to publish a Roll On episode today. However, good fortune prevented my bi-weekly confab with Adam Skolnick due to the birth of his son, Zuma James Kalu Skolnick (perhaps the most epic baby name of all time) who arrived in the 3rd dimension this past Saturday at 6:11pm PST. Massive congrats to Adam and momma bear April Wong. Baby and parents are doing well. Adam and I will be back together soon. In the meantime send them some love.And with that nugget of good news, I hope you enjoy today's episode in the spirit in which it is offered -- with radiant love.Peace + Plants,Listen, Watch & SubscribeApple Podcasts | YouTube | Spotify | Stitcher | Google PodcastsThanks to this week’s sponsorsBlinkist: Unlimited access to read or listen7.7K RatingsI started listening a 2 years back by accident, when I decided I wanted only to put positive content into my life while I was trying to change my lifestyle.

I see a Erin Brockovich is a guest but in general you don’t plug women's work.  Why may that be?   There aren’t any worthwhile podcasts by women maybe?   There aren’t any women working to get the vote out?   And of course there is Oprah in the self help arena but she’s frequently ridiculed (not on your show of course).

September 14, 2020

“The actions you take determine your identity.”Rangan Chatterjee, MDAs 2020 continues to unfurl in a fashion beyond surreal, more and more are descending into the anguished abyss of distress. Awakening to acrid tangerine skies that have transformed sunny California into a Blade Runner dystopia, I myself vacillate between melancholia and a commitment to forge a better world.When the darkness descends, I find sanity in focusing only on those things I can control: my actions and reactions. Nonetheless, waves of anxiety — and sometimes even despair — continue to break on the shores of my consciousness. It is in these moments that I resort to a battery of simple but generally quite effective contrary actions. I spend time in nature. Double down on meditation and human connection. I eat better and move more. And I extend myself in service to others.To further explore the many practical and unexacting things we can all undertake during this stressful time to course-correct our emotional disposition, reframe our reality and sustainably serve our well-being, I’m joined by my friend Rangan Chatterjee, M.D. — who today returns for a third spin on the RRP flywheel.One of the most influential doctors in the U.K., Rangan is a pioneer in the field of progressive, functional medicine. He is double board-certified in internal medicine and family medicine, holds an honors degree in immunology, and has appeared on seemingly every prominent media outlet from the BBC to The New York Times. In addition, Rangan prevails over the wildly popular Feel Better, Live More podcast. His TEDx talk, How To Make Diseases Disappear, has been viewed almost 3 million times. And he is the author of three #1 Sunday Times bestselling books. The focus of today’s conversation is his latest well-being tome, Feel Better In 5.A close cousin to my podcast with Atomic Habits author James Clear (RRP #401), today’s exchange is all about habit change and habit formation. It’s about the power of bite-sized actions. And how, when undertaken regularly, short and simple practices can rapidly and completely change your health and life.We discuss the difference between breaking bad habits versus crowding them out with new, better habits.We explore the realities of food addiction. Our epidemic of emotional eating. And Rangan’s personal theory on cause and solution.We talk generally about holistic health and lifestyle medicine, and why progressive wellness should be accessible to all — now more than ever.Interspersed throughout, Rangan shares how he has helped patients relieve stress, find fulfillment, and engender peace in these chaotic times.But most importantly, we explore his very simple, almost effortless, methods for building a new and sustainable lifestyle to serve our long-term health.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube (courtesy of Zoom). And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I always enjoy time spent with Rangan, even when it’s remote. My hope is that you do as well — and put his advice into action.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

September 7, 2020

“We are all naturally wired to serve — as children, people, and humans. Instead we’ve been educated for greed. Live your life half self, half service.”Jay ShettyLast week we went deep with an actual monk. Today we extend this exploration with a former monk — a renounced renunciant who returned to relate the wisdom gleaned for the betterment of all.Meet Jay Shetty.If that name rings a bell, it’s likely due to his social media omnipresence. With a global following in excess of 20 million people, Jay has a knack for creating what he calls viral wisdom — snackable videos based on ancient tenets that have surpassed 7 billion views — making him one of the most viewed people on the internet.A graduate of Cass Business school with an honors degree in Behavioral Science, Jay has been named one of Forbes magazine’s 30-under-30. He’s been invited to keynote at companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. He is the host of the popular On Purpose podcast. And the occasion for today’s conversation is Jay’s new book, Think Like A Monk — a distillation of the timeless wisdom learned during his ascetic days on an ashram into practical tools we can all use to live a less anxious, more meaningful life.Today the man Russell Brand (RRP 448) calls ‘a cat-eyed mystic’ shares his story.This is a conversation about Jay’s most unusual journey. His decision to shirk the predictable post-college path and instead move to India. The three-year exploration of austerity that indelibly changed his worldview. His decision to return home, fueled by a desire to make an impact. And the most remarkable path that followed.We discuss the insights he gleaned along the way — and the many tools freely available to underscore our lives with greater meaning and purpose.Among many other subjects, we explore the plausibility of conscious capitalism. The double-edged sword of social media. And how to use commerce and attention for good. To spread love. Encourage laughter. And arouse souls from the waking dream that defines the lives of far too many.Note: This was taped pre-pandemic over 6 months ago, when the world was a very different place. Coronavirus delayed the original release of Jay’s book from Spring to Fall, so I agreed to hold on publishing this episode until now.You can watch it all go down (in my original home studio) on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.This conversation is more than just whimsical ramblings. Jay’s methods for mindfulness and self-actualization are evidence-based and platitude-free. Just perceptions and practical takeaways you can adopt right now that will positively reconfigure your reality.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

7,Radhanath Swami,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/radhanath-swami-543/,"Episode 543
September 3, 2020

“True wisdom, true enlightenment… is to see every living being with equal vision.”Radhanath SwamiAs a reminder that we are spiritual beings inhabiting a material world — wandering this rotating orb as it hurls across the multiverse  — it’s time to once again transcend the mortal coil to connect with all things ethereal. Our guide for today’s celestial adventure is the candescent Radhanath Swami.A New York Times best-selling author, monk, philanthropist, activist and teacher, his Holiness Radhanath Swami is a man that radiates love, compassion and grace with a sweet and joyous disposition that has immeasurably impacted millions of souls across the world.Born Richard Slavin to middle-class parents in Chicago, he came of age amidst the strife and upheaval of the 1960s. A social activist, he slowly became disillusioned with the structural mandates of the western civilized way of life. So, still in his late teens, he left Chicago behind in search of greater meaning. After hitchhiking across the world, he felt called to India. There he met his spiritual teacher, catalyzing his transformation into the mystic he is today.Along the way, Radhanath Swami has founded multiple spiritual communities throughout the world, the most prominent of which is the Radha-Gopinath Ashram located in Mumbai, India. Under his inspiration and guidance, the project has grown to include hospitals, orphanages, a UN-awarded eco-friendly farm, schools, temples, emergency relief programs, and a food distribution program that feeds more than 300,000 children in India every single day. In addition, he teaches Eastern philosophy and spiritually throughout Europe, Asia, and America. His wisdom has reached over 100,000,000 views on social media in the last year. He has been featured as a guest speaker at Oxford, Cambridge, Princeton, Harvard, Columbia and Stanford, and at corporations such as HSBC, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Intel and Oracle. Along the way he has  met with many a world leader, including Barak Obama and former Prime ministers Tony Blair, David Cameron and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Today he shares his story.This conversation is fueled by my concern for cultural cohesion — a desire to help mend the vitriolic division and existential tension that is tearing us apart.Therefore, beyond exploring Radhanath Swami’s story of origin, we spend the gravamen of our exchange examining what he calls ‘the light’. It’s about how to embody the space within ourselves that brims with compassion and empathy — and why a committed spiritual practice is more important now than ever.I understand that some may recoil when it comes to topics spiritual. But this is not about religion. And it’s not about dogma. Simply put, it’s about why love is the answer.So look past the robe. Set aside preconceived opinions. Open your heart a crack. And be present to receive what this evolved human has to share. If you do, I think this powerful conversation will leave you feeling nourished, more hopeful and immensely more positive about our global predicament. Today’s mind meld is viewable (via Zoom) on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Final Note: I intended to publish a Roll On episode today. However, good fortune prevented my bi-weekly confab with Adam Skolnick due to the birth of his son, Zuma James Kalu Skolnick (perhaps the most epic baby name of all time) who arrived in the 3rd dimension this past Saturday at 6:11pm PST. Massive congrats to Adam and momma bear April Wong. Baby and parents are doing well. Adam and I will be back together soon. In the meantime send them some love.And with that nugget of good news, I hope you enjoy today’s episode in the spirit in which it is offered — with radiant love.Peace + Plants,

August 31, 2020

“Now more than ever people need to be heathy. They need to stop distracting themselves and they need to eat more plants.”Darin OlienHot on the heels of Down To Earth — the #1 hit Netflix series in which he co-stars alongside Zac Efron — today my superfood hunting, brother-from-another-mother Darin Olien returns for his 4th appearance on the podcast to blow minds and drop wisdom on all things nutrition, hydration, ecological preservation, longevity, and living a high-vibration life.One of my most popular guests to date, Darin’s biography reads like a Hemingway adventure novel. Devoted to advancing human health, ecological preservation and sustainability, he’s spent the better part of the last 20 years embedded in remote farming communities across the Himalayas, South Pacific, Latin America and Asia, scavenging for the most nutritionally potent plants, nuts, and seeds on the planet.His most recent obsession is Barùkas (aka the baru nut) — an incredibly nutrient-rich superfood known to the indigenous tribes of the Brazilian Cerrado for millennia, yet virtually unheard of anywhere else. This discovery led to Darin to an epiphany: he could help preserve the Cerrado (which is a tropical savanna ecoregion three times the size of Texas) by employing its indigenous communities to harvest the native baru and importing them to North America. A win-win to preserve precious environmental resources, support indigenous communities,  and simultaneously introduce North America to the healthiest nut on the planet.Everything Darin has learned over the decades is laid bare on the pages of Superlife, his New York Times bestselling primer on all things health and well-being. His 121Tribe.com app will put you on a 21-day lifestyle-changing diet and exercise program. And his recently launched podcast, The Darin Olien Show, is already killing the game.Down To Earth introduced to a broad, mainstream audience what I’ve always known about this incredible human:A man who truly walks his talk, Darin is the real deal.Picking up where we left off two years ago in RRP 382, Darin and I discuss all things Down To Earth. The show’s origins. What it was like collaborating with a global superstar. The show’s overnight impact on Darin’s life. And the show’s impact on countless people across the world.We discuss his commitment to forging a more sustainable food system. The impact of Barùkas on the indigenous farming communities of the Brazilian Cerrado. And his plans for leveraging new found fame to cultivate community around well-being and drive global ecological preservation.Finally, we explore Darin’s daily habits. The overlooked importance of hydration. And Darin’s personal water routine (it’s intense).May this conversation leave you understanding why Darin is the first person I turn to for advice not just on nutrition and fitness — but on all manner of subjects related to living my best authentic life.For those new to me and Big D, we’ve logged about 6 hours of extraordinary back catalog conversation over the years. I highly suggest you visit those archived episodes, which you can find here: RRP 382, RRP 268, and RRP 153.The visually inclined can watch our exchange on YouTube. And as always, the podcast streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Note: In the interest of total transparency and because I believe wholeheartedly in Darin’s mission, I am a Barùkas ambassador.

9,Dr. Alan Goldhamer,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/alan-goldhamer-541/,"Episode 541
August 24, 2020

“Healthy life expectancy is more important than life expectancy.”Dr. Alan GoldhamerWhen you hear the word ‘addiction’, our attention typically turns to mind-altering substances — illicit drugs, alcohol, and prescription medications.Typically overlooked in this conversation? Food.But food addiction isn’t just real, it just might be our biggest problem. In fact, the hyper-industrialized western world is firmly entrenched in an epidemic of dysfunctional eating, fueled by an outsized appetite for an ever-increasing array of highly processed foods that are scientifically designed — with just the right amount of sugar, salt and fat — to hijack our nervous system. Enslave us to compulsive habits that lead to illness. And ultimately render us wards of the pharmaceutical industry.Meanwhile we’ve normalized this twisted and deleterious relationship. So much so that right now, more than two-thirds of adults in the industrialized world are overweight or obese. Nonetheless, millions of people find it extremely difficult if not downright impossible to change their dietary habits — and simply break the fatal, addictive grip.So how does one effectively transition to a healthy diet sustained over time? According to Dr. Alan Goldhamer, a great place to start is by fasting. I’m not talking about a couple days of drinking cold-pressed juice. I’m talking about nothing but water for upwards of 40 days.Even with strict medical supervision it sounds like scary quackery. But over the last few decades, Dr. Goldhamer has successfully supervised over 20,000 patient fasts. Along the way, he has seen lives transformed wholesale. Unhealthy eating habit addictions broken. Medications ditched. And countless illnesses overcome.An iconoclastic pioneer in his field,  Dr. Goldhamer is the founder of True North Health Center, one of the first (and largest) facilities in the world that specializes in medically supervised water-only fasting, along with medical and chiropractic services, psychotherapy and counseling, and more.His work and studies have appeared in countless medical journals. He was featured in the hit documentary What The Health. And his book The Pleasure Trap (co-authored by Dr. Doug Lisle), has helped countless thousands transcend their prison of compulsivity when it comes to food choice.Today he joins the podcast to walk us through all things fasting, food addiction, and the power of a whole plant diet to prevent and reverse the many chronic lifestyle ailments that unnecessarily impair millions of people across the world.Today’s conversation explores all things water-only fasting, from it’s origins dating back thousands of years across many cultures and religious traditions to the protocol Dr. Goldhamer administers today.We discuss how fasting can create the foundation to transition to a sustainable, healthy whole food plant diet. And we explore why he advocates an ‘SOS’ (very low salt oil and sugar) version of that diet.But more than anything, this is a powerful discourse on our uncomfortable relationship with food. How most of us don’t realize we are killing ourselves with our fork and knife. How our food, and our food culture, is making us fat, sick, and frankly miserable. And how almost all of us, despite weight and health, use food as an emotional crutch. I’m well aware that Dr. Goldhamer is controversial in certain circles. His approach represents a radical departure from our traditional western medical paradigm. But he also makes a lot of sense. And his results speak for themselves (I have several personal friends who have undergone his protocol).Final Note: Under no circumstances should anyone undertake a water fast of any length without the medical supervision of a trained professional. In other words, please do not try this at home.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the podcast streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.My hope is that Dr. Goldhamer will inspire you to think more deeply about the body’s profound ability to heal itself when treated properly. That food freedom is possible. And that none of us need fall prey to chronic food-borne illness.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

11,Apolo Ohno,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/apolo-ohno-539/,"Episode 539
August 17, 2020

“Every thought that enters our mind has a direct impact on how we feel, what we say, and ultimately the decisions we make.”Apolo OhnoI’ve had the pleasure of conversing with many an Olympian over the years, each with a uniquely impressive journey from obscurity to heights most can’t fathom.But what happens after the medal ceremony wraps, the klieg lights shutter, and the career comes to a close? When your entire life is centered on a moment now passed, how do you then shift overnight from podium to pedestrian? One would presume the skills learned as an athlete — mindset, focus, discipline, and teamwork — would seamlessly translate to success in the civilian world. In truth this transition is fraught; and has felled many of the greatest competitors among us.We love to celebrate our Olympic heroes. We relish in the dissection of their habits, wrapt in what makes them tick; what makes them great; and what distinguishes the very best from everyone else — all in service to that sliver of inspiration and applicability to our own lives.But this particular story, the story of civilian assimilation, is less told and far less understood. However, it’s also a story perhaps more instructive — and equally compelling — as the deconstruction of greatness.From private mental health struggles to debt, loss of identity and a lack of opportunities in retirement, the systems sending our athletes to the Olympics aren’t supporting them well in the long haul. And it’s gotta change.To help untangle this dark thread that connects those who have stood in the spotlight, I sat down with America’s most decorated Winter Olympian.Meet Apolo Ohno.An eight-time Olympic medalist in short track speed skating, Apolo is a twelve-time U.S. champion, a three-time overall World Cup champion and in 2008 he was Overall World Championship gold medalist. In 2019, he was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 2019.Today, Apolo is a New York Times bestselling author, serial entrepreneur, and acclaimed Olympic Games commentator. He also won Dancing With The Stars in 2007 and rocked the Ironman World Championships in 2014.Despite his post-skating career successes, Apolo knows well the mental perils of elite athleticism. Raised by a single dad, he took his dream all the way to the very top. When it was over he didn’t just face what might come next. For the first time, he had to discover who he was off the rink — and reimagine his life wholesale.This is a conversation about what it’s like to have a passion with a shelf life. The mental health repercussions of Olympic pursuit. And the pitfalls of prodigious success at a young age.More broadly, it’s a dialog about why we sabotage ourselves, and how to break this bad habit.And it’s about deconstructing those preconditioned beliefs we all have about who we are and what we are capable of achieving.Today, one of history’s all-time great Olympians provides a master class in mindset and intention: how to use it to our advantage, and what it takes to break the mold of what is possible. My hope is that this conversation will help you form a more holistic idea of who you are and what you seek to offer the world. I hope it encourages you to see the strength in vulnerability and the power in asking for help. But more than anything, I hope it breaks whatever illusion you have about what an Olympic athlete is and what an Olympic athlete is not.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the podcast streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.May you receive Apolo with an open heart.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

August 10, 2020

“Your brain’s best friend is your gut. You can’t separate the two. If you have an unhealthy gut, it’s going to affect your brain.”Will Bulsiewicz, MDWe are living in a moment of compounding collective stress—personal, pandemic, economic, civic, and political. This trauma and tumult comes with side effects both physical and psychological. How do we take care of our bodies during this incredibly stressful moment? Furthermore, how do we buttress our immune system to combat the virus?The answer, we are increasingly coming to understand, begins with the microbiome. In fact, you might be surprised to learn, the gut is home to 70% of our immune system.To glean a better understanding of what that means, I convened with Dr. Will Bulsiewicz, a lauded gastroenterologist & gut health guru whose life’s work is devoted to better comprehending the microbiome and the crucial role it plays in all facets of health, from brain function and hormone balance to weight management and everything in between.Affectionately known as ‘Dr. B’, Will is a graduate of Georgetown School of Medicine and a former chief medical resident at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and chief gastroenterology fellow at the University of North Carolina Hospitals. In addition, he received his Master of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI) from Northwestern University and a certificate in nutrition from Cornell University. He’s authored more than twenty articles in the top American gastroenterology journals and his New York Times bestselling book, Fiber Fueled: The Plant Based Gut Health Program For Losing Weight, Restoring Your Health, and Optimizing Your Microbiome, is a must-read primer on why gut health is so crucial–and everything you need to know to optimize it.Since the beginning of the pandemic, I’ve lamented the mainstream media’s lack of attention to caring for our immune system. So today we dive in.This is a conversation about all things microbiome and gut health. The mechanisms behind it and latest research findings.We discuss our epidemic of dysbiosis (lack of gut biome balance) and its relation to a litany of chronic diseases that unnecessarily plague too many. We explore the gut-brain connection. The paramount need to increase the biodiversity in our bodies and our environments. And (sorry carnivores) why fiber is king.In addition, in this time of excessive sterilization and sequestration, Dr. B provides practical takeaways on how we can improve our gut flora and optimize our immune system, without putting ourselves and others at risk.And finally, we talk fecal transplants. Because, let’s face it, I can’t have a gastroenterologist on the show and not ask about that.It was an honor to to converse with Dr. B–a fresh, new mind making big waves on the plant-based, microbiome scene. Passionate, empathetic and whip-smart, I enjoyed every minute. And I promise you will walk away from this episode armed to take your health to the next level.Note: I first came across Dr. B’s work by way of his many appearances on my friend Simon Hill’s wonderful Plant Proof Podcast (which you should all check out). The pandemic prevented an in-person exchange, so this conversation was recorded remotely a few months ago. Apologies in advance for any audio issues. We did the best we could.Final Note: Will just released The Plant-Fed Gut, a comprehensive 7-week online course about microbiome health and reversing dysbiosis that goes beyond what he was able to offer in his book.

“When you don’t acknowledge that racism actually exists–that my experience may be different from yours because I’m black and you are white–then you are absolutely perpetuating racism.”Mirna ValerioWhen you hear the words “professional runner” what image pops into your head?Most likely it’s some version of a skinny white male in tiny shorts.Let’s just say Mirna Valerio is here to smash that stereotype — and completely redefine what it means to be an accomplished endurance athlete.She’s not White. She’s not a dude. And she isn’t skinny.She is a total badass of her own design.Back for a long-awaited sequel to RRP #340, Mirna is back to drop truth bombs left and right on all things body inclusion, identity, and diversity in the outdoors.For those new to Mirna, aka the force of nature affectionately known as The Mirnavator, she is one of the most inspirational athletes I have ever met — a true ambassador of sport on a mission to empower humans of all shapes, sizes, colors and genders to proudly embrace their bodies, expand their horizons, and own their personal truth.Today’s conversation picks up where we last left off, spanning her evolution into a full-time sponsored running professional to her work as as a diversity and inclusion educator.We talk about identity, and the way in which we see ourselves as the lens through which we interpret the world. We discuss the difference between body inclusion versus body positivity and acceptance.We talk about everyday racism in the outdoor world and industry–and the work required to assess and overcome our own internalized unconscious beliefs.And it’s about defining your values and embodying them in your actions–day in and day out.Mirna’s joyful self-acceptance is both real and rare. It’s authentic and bold. And it’s as infectious as it is inclusive. She is totally unapologetic, far from sheepish, and 100% herself.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I must confess: after almost 130 days in relative quarantine, melancholy has crept up on me. But there is something about Mirna’s gleeful demeanor that cheered me up.I think she will cheer you up as well.

July 27, 2020

“It’s up to us to create a system that cancels the apocalypse and protects humanity and all life.”Margaret Klein Salamon, PhDIn the words of today’s guest, “we are in a moment of acute collective suffering.”I couldn’t agree more.From our nation’s current civil rights struggles to a metastasizing global pandemic, the pain is real, exacerbated by a political system that seems hardwired to exacerbate problems at the cost of actually solving them.Fomenting a collective sense of existential dread is the dark beast of climate change, an accelerating background hum that can leave even the most optimistic overwhelmed by a sense of powerlessness.Hitting the brakes isn’t enough. We’re overdue to jam the engine into reverse. We need an immediate call to action. We need a ‘Manhattan Project’ scale approach to reckon with the objective truth of our dire predicament.Margaret Klein Salamon, PhD is here to guide us. A Harvard graduate and self-dubbed “climate psychologist,” Margaret is the founder and executive director of The Climate Mobilization, a volunteer organization dedicated to initiating a transformation of the economy, politics, and society to respond to the climate emergency. She is also the author of  Facing the Climate Emergency: How to Transform Yourself with Climate Truth, an emotional guide to processing our impending apocalypse, and the subject of today’s exchange.Recorded remotely in early June, this is a conversation about our emotional response to climate change, and tools for contributing to the positive change required of us.It’s about the intersectionality of the climate crisis–it’s ties to the pandemic as well as the protests.It’s about the inherent conflict between capitalism and environmentalism–and how we must de-couple corporate self-interest from the public good. And it’s about how to deal with weaponized media and the way in which we are being spoon-fed lies by conglomerated industry over-invested in maintaining the status quo.But more than anything, this is a discourse about effective altruism–and the actionable steps we can take now to backtrack from the global suicide that grows closer daily.It’s normal to feel disheartened. Action seems futile. And 2020 has maxed out our collective bandwidth to emotionally manage crises and revolutions. But embracing the truth and finding a way to contribute to positive change is not only mandatory — it’s a path to hope. And to girding your life with more meaning, inclusion and empathy.This is one of my increasingly rare audio-only podcasts. You can find it streaming wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Margaret’s ideologies have totally reframed how I perceive, address, and talk about the climate crisis. My hope is that her words offer you a perspective that is honest and hopeful.But more than anything, my hope is that it inspires you to do something.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

July 23, 2020

“Big goals are achieved by tiny wins daily.”Rich RollWelcome to another edition of Roll On—my bi-weekly deep dive into (semi) current events, topics of audience interest, and of course answers to your questions.Serving up hype-man duties is Adam Skolnick, an activist and veteran journalist perhaps best known as David Goggins’ Can’t Hurt Me co-author. Adam has written about adventure sports, environmental issues and civil rights for outlets such as The New York Times, Outside, ESPN, BBC, and Men’s Health. He is the author of One Breath, which chronicles the life and death of America’s greatest freediver, and is currently hard at work on a novel.Today’s conversation begins with a quick update on my forthcoming book Voicing Change and the subscription offering we are currently building.We then pivot to ruminations on goal setting based upon my personal experience and that of my many past guests.We talk about the latest coverage of the coronavirus, spikes across the country, the mask-authoritarianism debate, and the current constitutional crisis occurring in Portland.We honor the legacy of John Lewis, exploring his history and many accomplishments, including his pivotal role in the civil rights movement.We shoutout my friends Utkarsh Ambudkar and Darin Olien and their respective Netflix offerings: We Are Freestyle Love Supreme and Down to Earth–both mandatory quarantine viewing. We discuss the KFC-Beyond Chicken collaboration debut. And we send some love to legendary ultra runner Tommy Rivs — a beloved athlete and friend currently in the ICU (now in a coma since recording) suffering from undiagnosed COVID-like symptoms and severe respiratory distress. If you’re able, please consider a donation to Tommy’s GoFundMe to ameliorate medical expenses. A little goes a long way.And finally, we switch gears to answer a few questions submitted by audience members on our Facebook Group page and voicemail.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Thank you to Patrick Dean, Bel Rumi, Joe from Pittsburgh, Bill Lawrence and Julie from Minnesota for your questions. If you want your query discussed, drop it on our Facebook Page, or better yet leave a voicemail at (424) 235-4626. I’m digging this new format.

25,Dr. Andrew Huberman,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/andrew-huberman-533/,"Episode 533
July 20, 2020

“Behavior first. Thoughts, feelings and perceptions follow.”Andrew HubermanYou can’t teach an old dog new tricks. Past the ripe age of 25, we are fully cooked; calcified in our ways. So dispense with the idea of learning a new language, skill, or thought pattern—it’s just not happening.But what if that idea is simply false?What if I told you that you actually have the power to change your brain and reprogram your perception, irrespective of age?This is the life’s work of today’s guest, Andrew Huberman, Ph.D.A neuroscientist and tenured professor in the Department of Neurobiology at Stanford University School of Medicine, Andrew specializes in neuroplasticity–the brain’s ability to reorganize and repair itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. He is the recipient of the McKnight Foundation Neuroscience Scholar Award, a Biomedical Scholar Award from the Pew Charitable Trusts and in 2017 Andrew received the ARVO Cogan Award for making major contributions to the fields of vision science and efforts to regenerate the visual system and cure blindness. In addition, his work in the Huberman Lab at Stanford has been featured on the pages of Science, Discover, Scientific American, Time, and the New York Times, not to mention countless peer-reviewed journals.First and foremost, this is a conversation about what it really takes to shift our thought patterns.A master class on all things neuroplasticity, Dr. Huberman walks us through the brain’s inherent ability to modify itself based on experience and how we can advantageously leverage this process–through focus, mindfulness and restorative sleep–to not only learn new skills but also improve all essential aspects of well-being.We cover his research in self-motivation, and how we can hijack our dopamine systems and optimize stress to move forward in difficult situations. We discuss the inner workings of our nervous systems and how we can use our physical bodies—our diaphragms and visual systems—to access and optimize certain states of mind.And we also explore Dr. Huberman’s personal transformation. How he transcended family dysfunction and his days as a punk rock skater truant. And the most unlikely path he blazed to becoming the celebrated scientist he is today.But more than anything, this is a conversation about how to better self-regulate ourselves as animals.We are experiencing a cultural devolution in which society has become  biochemically addicted to entrenched, all-or-nothing thinking and myopic perceptions of life. Simply put, emotions cloud our judgment. This discourse is a vital effort to better understand the powerful role cognitive bias and hormones like dopamine and adrenaline play in affirming our world views—and shutting us down to the opinions and experiences of others.Andrew teaches us that to shift the way that you function, changing your behavior is the first step. I just see it as the science backing my favorite mantra — mood follows action.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.The Appetizer: People seemed to enjoy my previous brief check-in segments with Mishka Shubaly and Nadia Bolz-Weber so I thought I’d do it again. Today’s main course warm-up comes courtesy of my friend Utkarsh Ambudkar, the linguistically dexterous musician, actor and rapper longtime listeners will recall from RRP #373. The occasion is the release of We Are Freestyle Love Supreme—a must see documentary that chronicles a tribe of über-talented artists–including UTK and one Lin-Manuel Miranda–from humble beginnings to Broadway superstardom. I love this film. Check it immediately on Hulu (and no, this is not a sponsored thing).Final Note: If you’re enjoying my bi-weekly ‘ask me anything’ themed-episodes and have a question you’d like answered on air you can drop it on our Facebook Group page or leave us a voicemail.

July 13, 2020

“If you’re ever going to start exercising, get your sleep schedule right, reduce stress or start eating healthy–now is the time to do it.”Michael Greger, MDA powerful primer on all matters pandemic pertinent, today Michael Greger, M.D., FACLM returns for his fourth appearance on the podcast to answer all your coronavirus queries and more.A graduate of Cornell University and Tufts University School of Medicine as well as a founding member and Fellow of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, Dr. Greger is the nutrition science wizard behind NutritionFacts.org — the world’s most authoritative, non-profit, science-based public service destination for all things nutrition, health and disease prevention.His massively popular books, including How Not to Die, How Not To Diet, and their cookbook analogues, all became instant New York Times Best Sellers and crowned Dr. Greger a media darling, his excitable face popping up everywhere from The Dr. Oz Show to The Colbert Report.Less well known is the fact that, prior to his focus on nutrition, Dr. Greger had an entire career as an internationally-recognized expert on public health. A specialist in emerging infectious diseases, he’s been sounding the pandemic alarm for over a decade.Back then, nobody was listening. Now they are. To wit, Dr. Greger’s latest release, How To Survive A Pandemic, now available in audiobook and kindle with a paperback version hitting the shelves August 18, forms the basis of today’s conversation.Today’s exchange is hyper focused on the public and political health disaster that is the novel coronavirus. The even more deadly impending H7N9 bird flu. And the common thread between these and other zoonotic diseases: humanity’s broken relationship with animals.I seize the opportunity to ask Dr. Greger his expert opinion on all my (and perhaps your) lingering questions about what exactly is happening:And perhaps the most fundamental question of all, how can we stop the emergence of pandemics in the first place?The answer begins with the dismantling of our industrialized factory farming infrastructure.Not only are America’s factory farms vile for the animals and the workers that slaughter them, but they are essentially breeding grounds for future pandemics. This is a call for the eradication of these systems–a moral imperative if we want to preserve not only our environment but the long-term viability of our species.This is an important, alarming, and downright terrifying moment of truth. So pay attention.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify. If you’re new to the show and interested in exploring Dr. Greger’s work in nutrition, jump back to RRP #7, #199, and #522.Final Note: If you’re enjoying my bi-weekly ‘ask me anything’ themed-episodes and have a question you’d like answered on air you can drop it on our Facebook Group page or leave us a voicemail.

“Seeing what human compassion could do to an animal gave me a new awareness that I had never understood before, that human actions directly affect the animals that we coexist with.”Harley Quinn SmithOver the last several episodes, I’ve endeavored to shoulder healthy and thoughtful conversations about what matters most right now — the pandemic, racial injustice, systemic racism, police brutality and food injustice.Today we shift from that somber gear for an interlude of reprieve.Enter entertainment’s ultimate plant-based father-daughter duo: Kevin Smith & Harley Quinn Smith.An indie film legend, Kevin is also an actor, comedian, comic book writer, author and early podcast pioneer — a voice of huge influence on my personal career behind a microphone.In 1994, Kevin burst into prominence with his hyper low-budget comedy Clerks, a film he wrote, directed, co-produced, and filmed in the convenience store where he worked. Premiering at Sundance, it was fêted with the festival’s highest award before going on to become an indie cult classic.In addition to countless appearances in both movies and television, Kevin has created a litany of films, affectionately and collectively referred to by his many rabid fans as the View Askewiverse, a nod to Kevin’s production shingle, View Askew Productions.Returning to his roots (did he ever leave?), Kevin toured his latest film, Jay and Silent Bob Reboot (featuring names like Chris Hemsworth and Ben Affleck) to roadshow box office success, promoting it with pre-pandemic live events in over 60 cities across North America.An iconic and beloved character amongst indie film fans and comic book nerds, Kevin has always been immediately recognizable and famous for his hockey jerseys, backward hat and well, his weight.  But in February of 2018, Kevin had a near-fatal heart attack.A lifestyle change was needed. Desperately. Enter Harley.An actress, animal rights activist and bass player for the bubblegum punk band, The Tenth, Harley suggested —some might say coerced—Kevin to adopt her plant-based ways. Kevin obliged. In short, he dropped 50 pounds and kept the weight off. His blood work normalized. And the rest is history.Together they recently launched Vegan Abattoir—a daddy daughter podcast affair that provides plant-based answers to the vegan-curious questions they get from a meat-eating and dairy-drinking audience. Dare you enter? If so you can catch yours truly in episode 2.Picking up where I left off with Kevin in last year’s barnburner 2.5 hour Vulcan mind meld (RRP #433), Today’s discussion centers primarily on veganism and animal rights. What led Harley to adopt this lifestyle, the way it has transformed her life, and that of her Dad. It’s about the many projects these two have up their sleeve, from restaurants to non-profits, to upcoming films.It’s a peek into the life of a Hollywood family, and the complicated dynamics of the movie biz and stardom — including a touching remembrance of Stan Lee and the story behind Harley landing a Manson girl part in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.The gleeful banter between Harley and Kevin is infectious. And while this conversation is light, I promise there is much to be gleaned — especially if you are new to the vegan world or perhaps contemplating a more-plant based approach to your plate and life.I’ve interviewed a lot of people. Few are as skilled as Kevin in the art of conversation. And Harley just made it all so much better. Enjoy!Peace + Plants,

29,John Lewis + John Salley,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/lewis-and-salley-529/,"Episode 529
June 29, 2020

“You’re not going to be liked by everybody but if someone’s going to hate you – let them hate you for doing the right thing.”John LewisToday I reconnect with my friends John Salley & John Lewis to discuss the black experience, race in America, food injustice, and where we go from here.A legit living legend, John Salley is the first basketball player in history to win four NBA championships with three different teams — the Pistons, Bulls & Lakers — in three different decades. Since retiring in 2000, John has been a consistent media presence across television, radio, film and new media — appearing on countless programs as a host, commentator and creator.A long-time vegan, Salley is also a passionate animal rights and healthy nutrition advocate (which we discussed in RRP 180). In addition, he’s an absolutely relentless entrepreneur, involved in a myriad of enterprises from vegan wine to cannabis. John’s latest venture is Cafe Organix, a new plant-based restaurant he launched to help eradicate the food deserts that plague the Black and Brown communities of San Bernardino, California.A prominent, ultra-positive voice in the vegan movement, John Lewis — aka The Badass Vegan — is a public speaker, personal trainer, and entrepreneur who can now add filmmaker to the resume. In partnership with mutual friend Keegan Kuhn (RRP 91, 176, 278, & 397), the co-director behind Cowspiracy, What The Health, and Running For Good, John is inching towards completion of They’re Trying To Kill Us — a powerful upcoming documentary that examines the impact of food & health injustice on disenfranchised African American communities (a subject I first explored with John in RRP 260).Busting traditional vegan stereotypes with a unique ability positively impact a wide diversity of people, John’s story and broad smile has appeared on multiple television shows and in such publications as Muscle & Fitness, Men’s Fitness, Thrive, Origin, Maxim, and even Sports Illustrated.Today we break bread. Black Lives Matter. Police misconduct. The pernicious nature of systemic racism. How religious institutions embed white supremacy.We also discuss the importance of black leadership and entrepreneurship. And we close with thoughts on food injustice — how our broken food system negatively and disproportionately impacts communities of color.But most of all, this is a conversation about what is necessary to make things right. What black and brown communities need from white allies. And the ways in which we can grow, change, and do better — together.Note: Click here to check out the recently released and incredibly compelling trailer for They’re Trying To Kill Us. Then visit the film’s Indiegogo campaign to learn how you can support the film.Language Advisory: This one is packed with expletives, so pop on the earbuds if you got kiddos in the backseat.Finally, I suspect this will be an uncomfortable conversation for some; maybe for many. I invite you to listen or watch with an open mind and heart. Notwithstanding, these guys are a total blast. I love them both. I’m grateful for their friendship — and their honesty.The visually inclined can watch our conversation on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.  Strap in.Peace + Plants,

30,Ask Me Anything,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/roll-on-528/,"Episode 528
June 25, 2020

“Truth matters now more than ever. If we can’t agree upon what is and is not true, how do we move forward as a society?”Rich RollWelcome to the second installment of our newly-minted ‘ask me anything’ themed series, ‘Roll On:’ — a twist on my usual format in which I share my thoughts on select topics and answer audience questions.Serving up co-host duties is Adam Skolnick, an activist and veteran journalist perhaps best known as David Goggins’ Can’t Hurt Me co-author. Adam has written about adventure sports, environmental issues and civil rights for outlets such as The New York Times, Outside, ESPN, BBC, Men’s Health and many others; and he is the author of One Breath, which chronicles the life and death of Nick Mevoli, America’s greatest freediver.Today’s conversation begins with a few thoughts on the current protests and a review of recent podcast feedback.We also discuss the intersectionality of food insecurity and social justice. And we examine the importance of healing our food deserts — a featured theme in next week’s episode with filmmaker John Lewis and NBA legend John Salley.The podcast then pivots to answer five relatively philosophical questions submitted by audience members on our Facebook Group page:It’s about reclaiming your truth. Breaking down negative feedback loops. And crafting a gentler, more objectively honest narrative about who you are and what you’re capable of.The visually inclined can watch our conversation on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify. This series (and recent episodes) is an experiment in venturing out of my comfort zone. An effort to grow. And a commitment to evolve the show. I appreciate you taking the leap with me. I hope you find the content valuable — and in service to forging a stronger RRP community.Peace + Plants,

31,Knox Robinson,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/knox-robinson-527/,"Episode 527
June 22, 2020

“This is our chance…to think beyond what the mainstream media is telling us.”Knox RobinsonAgainst the backdrop of a global pandemic has emerged the most powerful civil rights movement of our lifetime — an irrefutably historic moment that will indelibly shape the economic, political, and social fabric of our country for decades to come.To help us untangle the rhetoric behind our country’s supercharged division, today Knox Robinson joins the podcast.Returning for his second appearance on the show (RRP #394 rests among my all time favorite episodes), Knox is a writer, athlete, and national caliber runner. He’s also an eponymous curator of running culture, informed by his passion for black history, art, literature, music and poetry. Formally commencing under the tutelage Poet Laureate Maya Angelou at Wake Forest University, Knox’s education has continued throughout the many chapters of his life. As a spoken word artist and music manager. As editor-in-chief of Fader magazine. And more recently as co-founder and captain of Black Roses NYC —  a diverse collective of running enthusiasts who routinely gather to hammer out intervals across Brooklyn & downtown Manhattan.Put plainly, urban culture is Knox’s lifeblood.One of the most interesting and multi-faceted humans I have ever met, today Knox shares an important perspective on America’s crossroads. This is an investigation into the culture shifts caused by the pandemic and protests alike. It’s a conversation about the intersection of sport, politics and civil rights. Black American representation in athletics. And where we go from here.It’s also about virtue signaling. Performative allyship. And why reading White Fragility simply isn’t enough. But more than anything, this is a conversation about the power and poetics of running. Running as metaphor. Running as an act of rebellion — and the disturbing symbolism behind Ahmaud Arbery’s murder. The visually inclined can watch our conversation on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.This is a special conversation. I’m better for having had it. I hope you will be similarly impacted.Peace + Plants,

32,"Byron Davis & Phil Allen, Jr.",https://www.richroll.com/podcast/byron-davis-pastor-phil-allen-526/,"Episode 526
June 15, 2020

“Ignorance is the beginning of enlightenment.”Byron DavisFor many, the last few weeks have been a wake-up call. A reckoning with the uncomfortable reality that misuse of power, police abuse, and racism (both overt and covert) are baked into the very fabric of our nation.But for black people, African Americans and people of color, that pain, violence, and fear is an everyday reality.I’m determined to better understand this unfortunate dynamic. The history that led to it. The systemic nature of it. The institutions that perpetuate it. And the solutions required for its long-overdue undoing.Part of that commitment is sharing an increased diversity voices.Towards that end, today I reconnect with my friend Byron Davis, alongside Pastor Phil Allen, Jr.One of my very first podcast guests (RRP #14 from early 2013), Byron is a former USA Swimming National Team member, American Record holder, UCLA All-American, and Ironman who holds the distinction of falling just three-tenths of a second shy of becoming the first African-American to make the USA Olympic Men’s Swimming Team. A role model for thousands of young athletes, the obstacles Byron faced and overcame on his path to success is inspiring. With a Masters degree in Organizational Leadership, Byron is now a sought after speaker and consultant — a special human with a penchant for helping others unleash their inner potential. Phil is a pastor, author, teacher, poet, and the filmmaker behind Open Wounds, a powerful documentary that delves into the reality of intergenerational trauma through the story of his grandfather’s murder and the police’s subsequent refusal to investigate it (now available on Vimeo on demand). He is also the founding pastor of Own Your Faith Ministries in Santa Clarita, California and a second-year Ph.D. student at Fuller Theological Seminary studying Christian ethics and theology and culture, with a focus on Dr. King’s Theology and ethics, as well as the intersection of race theory and theology. Today Byron and Phil share their perspective on this moment. The history behind it. And the opportunity for change it represents. This is an important conversation about what it means to be black in America. It’s about the economic history of slavery in the United States.It’s about the extent to which racism is perpetuated systemically — by way of policy, law, economics, politics & generations of socialization.It’s about the ways in which white supremacy is embedded into the bedrock of our institutions — from religious and political to educational and judicial.And it’s about confronting the pernicious manner in which racism lives, breathes, and persists — often completely unconsciously — within ourselves.This country has arrived at a critical crossroads. A choice to implode or heal. The higher path demands responsibility. The awakening requires we examine history from a different perspective. It demands we define our personal and national values. And it dictates that we align those values with action. To dismantle what is broken. To rebuild our institutions. To reframe our relationships — and ourselves.Note: Regrettably, I was remiss in not exploring Phil’s work as a spoken word artist during the conversation. I encourage you check out his performances on YouTube, starting with ‘Colorblind But Not Colorless’ — which I found particularly powerful. And while you’re at it, read his most recent blog post, This Is America: Baptized in Whiteness.Final Note: I highly recommend (especially for those experiencing resistance to this conversation) watching 13th on Netflix, a documentary analysis of the criminalization of African Americans and the U.S. prison boom — and a master class in contextualizing the systemic aspect of racism. I’m grateful to Byron & Phil for their open, patient & vulnerable perspective on race. Their personal encounters with racism. And their stories of pain.The visually inclined can watch our conversation on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I truly believe that conversations like this are crucial if we want to finally transcend our past, learn, grow, and lead by example.To echo Cornel West, what we don’t need are lukewarm folk. We don’t need ‘summer soldiers’. What we need are all season love warriors.It is this spirit that I offer today’s conversation. May you receive it with an open heart.Peace + Plants,

33,Roll On: Black Lives Matter,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/black-lives-matter-525/,"Episode 525
June 11, 2020

“Right now we have a choice — stay silent or participate in historic, positive change.”Rich RollIt feels wrong to talk about anything other than this current historic moment.So let’s address it, head on.The first in what I anticipate will be an ongoing series of ask-me-anything themed episodes we’re calling ‘Roll On:’, I’m joined today by Adam Skolnick to discuss all things Black Lives Matter.Best known as the co-author of David Goggins’ juggernaut memoir, Can’t Hurt Me, Adam is an activist and veteran adventure journalist who has traveled the world writing for The New York Times, Playboy, Outside, ESPN, BBC, Men’s Health, and many other prominent publications. You may recall his outstanding reporting on Colin O’Brady’s historic solo Antarctica traverse in 2018 for The New York Times. And long-time listeners will fondly remember his 2016 appearance on the podcast (RRP #218), in which we discussed One Breath — his poetic biography of Nicholas Mevoli, America’s greatest freediver.Shifting roles from host to guest, today I share a perspective on race in America. Civil rights and social unrest. White privilege. And how I’m actively seeking to better myself — and this podcast as a whole.The RRP is not a news program. And it’s not a political talk show. But it is a show about what is important. It’s about having conversations that matter. And right now, no conversation matters more than redressing racial injustice.This is an exchange about our collective responsibility to act. To speak up for what is right. And to finally dismantle the systemic ills that have contributed to unspeakable harms that can no longer go unchecked.It’s also a discussion about the history and mission of this podcast. My vision for the future. And goals set to broaden the inclusivity of my advocacy.But more than anything, this is a dissection of the untold history of racism in America. And the unprecedented opportunity this unique moment presents to evolve and heal. As individuals. As a nation. And as a global community.Note: This is the simply the first of many conversations to come on the theme of race. Over the upcoming weeks I will be sharing impactful conversations with a variety of people of color, including Byron Davis, Phil Allen, Jr., Knox Robinson, John Lewis (aka ‘Badass Vegan’), John Salley, Shaka Senghor, Neil Phillips and many others. In the interim, I encourage you to explore the many copious resources listed in the show notes below. Read. Listen. Challenge yourself. Get active. Donate if you’re able.The visually inclined can watch our conversation on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.To coin Cornel West’s phrase, what we need right now is ‘all season love warriors.’It is in that spirit that I offer this exchange — with gratitude and respect for all my brothers and sisters.Peace + Plants,

34,Doug Evans,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/doug-evans-524/,"Episode 524
June 8, 2020

“Most people are living to eat. I am eating to live.”Doug EvansA recurring theme of this show is deconstructing peak performance. Over the years, I’ve shared the success equations of Olympic champions, entrepreneurs, actors, artists and spiritual masters — all roadmaps to better guide our collective trajectories.But failure is the crucible for wisdom. And the litmus test of character.What happens when you give every ounce of yourself to a creation, only to see it crumble? Destruction can be our greatest teacher. How we move forward tells us who we are.After an epic public defeat, Doug Evans was confronted with this challenge. Not only did he survive, he emerged better for it.A serial health food entrepreneur, you may recall Doug as the Silicon Valley, juice-slinging mogul behind Juicero — the infamous and futuristic wifi-connected, cold-press juicer start-up that raised $120 million from technology’s most high-powered VC’s before famously imploding in 2017. What you may not know is that Doug has always been a natural food industry pioneer. He co-founded O.G. New York City juice bar chain Organic Avenue, one of the first exclusively plant-based retail chains in the country. Now writing his next chapter, Doug recently released The Sprout Book, a primer on the power of sprouts as an ultra-food for health, weight loss, and optimum nutrition.Four years from our first conversation (RRP 221), today Doug returns to the podcast to share the valuable lessons learned from his Juicero experience — and his new focus on getting people excited about the planet’s most nutritious foods.Admittedly somewhat asynchronous with the current news cycle, this is nonetheless a conversation about a root cause of socio-economic disparity — and how to redress systemic food insecurity across impoverished food deserts nationwide.It’s about the importance of taking your health and nutrition to the next level — critical in the age of coronavirus.It’s a show-and-tell on the unheralded, superfood benefits of sprouts. The ease and affordability of growing your own at home. And the power of this practice to economically revolutionize your relationship with nutrition.In addition, we of course discuss all things Juicero. What happened. What can be gleaned from its demise. And the lessons Doug learned to better inform the decisions faced by every entrepreneur and business owner.Note: My first in-person interview since the start of the pandemic, this conversation (recorded on June 1 after conducting on site antibody tests) preceded my ability to timely schedule African American community leaders to directly converse on the historic events of the current moment. That said, I can assure you that I will be conducting several conversations with such leaders over the coming weeks.The visually inclined can watch our conversation on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.If your familiarity with Doug is limited to hyperbolic Juicero headlines, I ask that you set aside whatever pre-conceived notions you may harbor — and prepare to be delighted. A dear friend for many years, Doug is a beautiful man. A wonderful character unlike any human I have ever met. And a true example of selfless service to others.May you be equal parts entertained and enlightened by our exchange.Peace + Plants,

June 1, 2020

“If you don’t give yourself permission to create a new world, chances are nobody else will.”James AltucherChaos, confusion, fear and anger. Horrific racism. Generations of pain fueling rioting and violence. Death and illness. Faltering systems and leadership failures. Market crashes and jobs lost.Communities are divided. Home lives are disrupted. Meanwhile, cities all across America are literally on fire.The dystopia is here.How we can right the ship? Deal with these cataclysmic shifts? And move forward productively?I wrote some thoughts. You can read them on the blog.In summation, we can crash and burn. Or we can adapt — a remaking of society that begins with personal reinvention.James Altucher is a virtuoso of this process.A prodigious intellect and talented polymath, James is a comic, chess master, entrepreneur, investor and prolific writer with over twenty books to his name, including the Wall Street Journal bestseller Choose Yourself. He’s also a fellow podcaster and an unconventional thinker with an idiosyncratic lens on pretty much everything from creativity to finances.James and his writing have appeared in major media outlets including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The New York Observer, Techcrunch, and The Financial Times. His blog, JamesAltucher.com, has attracted more than 20 million readers since its launch in 2010. And The James Altucher Show ⁠regularly appears in the top 100 podcasts on iTunes.On the subject of self-experimentation, James’ latest unconventional move was releasing his latest self-published book, Think Like a Billionaire, on Scribd.Most compelling is James’ relentless devotion to constant reinvention. Making his fourth appearance on the podcast, today we explore the importance of this trait ⁠and the habits that enable you to adapt and thrive in rapidly changing times ⁠— more critical now than ever.Recorded pre-pandemic in mid-February, this conversation is the last in my stash of episodes banked before quarantine. Therefore there is no discussion about coronavirus or the current social unrest erupting across the nation.Nonetheless, I suspect you will find our discourse applicable to our current moment — packed with tactics and strategies you can deploy to better acclimate to the rapidly changing circumstances that face us all.It’s about how to make better decisions. And ultimately, how to leverage challenging moments to grow and evolve.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.James is one of my most favorite people. He’s a natural and gifted conversationalist, his ideas are easily deciphered, and packed with the perfect amount of humor and data-backed insight.To some degree, we are all being called to reinvent ourselves right now. May this conversation help serve that process.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

May 28, 2020

“I continue to be amazed by our bodies’ ability for self-repair. It’s never too late to start exercising and never too late to start eating healthier.”Michael Greger, MDWhen it comes to reliable nutrition information, the internet is a warn-torn, metastasizing mushroom cloud of toxic half-truths and misinformation.How do we sort through the tribal wars? How do we separate fact from fiction?Let’s start with seeking out the experts. And the best, most objective science available.This is the life’s work of today’s guest and my friend, Dr. Michael Greger.Long time listeners are well acquainted with Dr. Greger, one of my very first guests back in 2012 (RRP #007). But it’s been almost five years since his second appearance in 2015 (RRP #199). So let’s put matters to rights.A graduate of Cornell and Tufts University School of Medicine as well as a founding member and Fellow of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, Dr. Greger is a nutrition science wizard with a library of scientific journal publications to his name. He has testified before Congress; lectured at countless symposiums and institutions; and was an expert witness in the infamous Oprah Winfrey meat defamation lawsuit.Appearing everywhere from the Dr. Oz show to The Colbert Report, his books: How Not to Die, the How Not To Die Cookbook, and How Not To Diet — the focus of today’s conversation — all became instant New York Times Best Sellers.When Dr. Greger isn’t speaking, crafting high-level policy initiatives or penning bestsellers, he scours thousands of medical journals in search of the world’s best, most objective nutrition research to bring you free videos and articles every single day at NutritionFacts.org — the world’s most authoritative, non-profit, science-based public service destination for all things nutrition, health and disease prevention.Finally, it’s worth noting that 100% of all fees and proceeds he receives from speaking and book sales are donated to charity — his effort to avoid all conflicts of interest.Today’s conversation pivots on the optimal criteria to enable weight loss — and the actionable steps required to create and sustain healthy lifestyle practices.In addition, we explore how commercial influence corrodes nutrition science. How to parse the incredibly conflicting information we are spoon-fed daily by the media and celebrities alike.And finally, it’s about separating evidence-based science from confirmation bias.Note: This conversation was recorded in February, so it’s coronavirus free zone. For Dr. G’s take on our current state of affairs, check out his new audiobook released this week, How To Survive A Pandemic — a breakdown on the origins of zoonotic disease, how to protect ourselves, and what we must rectify to reduce the likelihood of future catastrophes.Dr. Greger is truly one of the most delightful, relentless, passionate, and service-minded humans I have ever met.It’s an honor to share this conversation. My hope is that it catalyzes a new perspective on nutrition for yourself and your loved ones.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Ultimately, the truth comes from within. It’s not something we find from the outside and bring into our lives. It’s something that was always there that we just discover.”David ClarkOn May 21, 2020, the world lost a treasure.A beloved, 2-time RRP alumni, David Clark was one of the most courageous, resilient and authentic human beings I’ve ever met. A force for positive change. A model of service. The epitome of transformation, embodied. A loyal friend to many. And a man blessed with a preternatural gift for igniting the best in everyone he touched.Succumbing after complications incident to a herniated disc surgery, a chapter ends far too soon. But the story behind this accomplished ultra-endurance athlete, bestselling author, and father of three is a legend that will continue to be told — and will never be forgotten.Today — Memorial Day — we memorialize the brilliant life and indelible legacy of Dave Clark.Dave’s steel was forged from hardship — periodic homelessness and a poverty both financial and educational. Adulthood found him descending into the firm grip of alcoholism. He ate recklessly. He drank and drugged himself into oblivion. And continued his downward spiral until he was utterly lost. Completely alone. And hopeless.Tipping the scales at 320 pounds, Dave finally met his breaking point. Summing a will of superhuman proportions, he ushered the courage to finally face his demons. Hence began a process of implausible personal transformation. It’s a staggering journey that would ultimately lead to breathtaking feats that defy possibility. And a laudable call to service that rivals anyone I’ve ever met.Dave didn’t just drop 150 pounds on a plant-based diet. Nor did he celebrate with a simple marathon. Instead, Dave would go on to on to crush a relentless list of the world’s most challenging ultra-marathons, from Badwater to Leadville. He ran the Boston Marathon course four times without stopping. And he even ran across the entire United States.With uncompromising vulnerability, Dave recounts his inconceivable arc in his first book, Out There. In Broken Open, he faces the dark side of taking athleticism too far. Released just two weeks ago, Eat Sh*t And Die boldly tackles food addiction head on.I can’t bring Dave back. Nor can I begin to measure his positive impact on myself and countless others. What I can do is honor his life and legacy. So today, RRP alums Mishka Shubaly and Josh LaJaunie — both close friends of Dave — join me to eulogize him, followed by a re-release of my first conversation with Dave, recorded in November, 2014 (RRP #113).Please Donate: To help alleviate the financial burden on Dave’s family, Mishka, Josh and I created a GoFundMe (actually Mishka did all the work). Anything you can contribute would be greatly appreciated. To learn more and donate, click here.#WeAreDavidClark: Mishka, Josh and I invite you to celebrate Dave with a virtual community run on May 30. The idea is to run a variation on Dave’s birthday (which is 2/5). Run .25 miles. Run 2.5 miles. Or run 25 miles. Run what feels right for you. The point is to run and remember. Then share it on social with the hashtag #WeAreDavidClark.More Dave Clark: If Dave’s message resonates with you, check out RRP #290, my 2nd podcast with him published almost exactly three years ago. It’s a banger.Dave was a sober warrior unlike any other. He wrung every last drop out of life. He was deeply loved and will be terribly missed.Let his story be a beacon. A reminder that when the body, mind and spirit align with faith, human potential is truly boundless.Or, to put it in Dave’s words, we are all Superman.Run free, my friend.

“I think what people find in tragic challenges is a part of themselves they didn’t know existed. A new character arises in the midst of grief.”Guru SinghWelcome back to another edition of Guru Multiverse — the latest in my ongoing series of spiritual deep dives with Guru Singh, my treasured friend and favorite wizard of all things mystical.For those newer to the show, imagine a modern-day Gandalf who rocks like Hendrix while dropping pearls of wisdom that beautifully fuse Eastern mysticism with Western pragmatism.A celebrated third-generation Sikh yogi, master spiritual teacher, author, and family man, for the past 40 years Guru Singh has been studying and teaching Kundalini Yoga. He is the author of several books, a powerful lecturer, and behind-the-scenes guide to many a luminary, including Fortune 500 CEOs, athletes, and artists.A peer of rock legends like Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead, Guru Singh is also a talented musician who began his recording career on Warner Bros’ Reprise label in the 1960s. When he isn’t recording tracks with people like Seal, he’s bringing down the house on the daily at Yoga West, his Los Angeles home base.As the pandemic has reminded us, the human body is delicate — a fragile soul vessel susceptible to a host of diseases and disasters. And it simply does not last forever — no matter how much we endeavor to deny or repress this universal truth.Today we explore the experience of being left behind. The emotions that follow. And the powerful lessons contained therein.Marking his 10th appearance on the show, this is a deconstruction of grief and loss. The potency it contains to both create and destroy. And the potential energy it holds for grace, gratitude and transformation.We talk about our relationships with our bodies. How to master our physical containers while also practicing non-attachment. We get raw about losing those we love. Owning our pain. And rejoicing in grief.Although this exchange was recorded well in advance of the pandemic (back in August 2019), Guru’s wisdom is timeless, easily digested and more pertinent now than ever.You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.If you’ve experienced loss and the grief that accompanies it, may Guru Singh’s gentle and loving energy, soothing words, and new perceptions guide you through your difficulties.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

39,Colin O'Brady,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/colin-obrady-519/,"Episode 519
May 18, 2020

“My mantra is: you’re strong, you’re capable.”Colin O’BradyIf you ask this week’s guest what drives his success as a multiple world record breaking adventure athlete, his answer just might surprise you.It’s not grit. It’s not talent, perseverance or focus. Instead, it’s infinite love.Returning for his fourth appearance on the podcast, Colin O’Brady is here to elaborate.Longtime listeners are well acquainted with Colin’s story from burn victim to boundary eclipsing adventurer. Even if you’re new to the podcast, chances are stumbled across his story by way of his appearances everywhere, from the Today show to the Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.For the unfamiliar few, Colin is a former Yale swimmer turned professional triathlete enjoying a third act as an elite adventure athlete with 5 breathtaking world records to his name.Notable among his many palmarès, Colin is both the youngest and fastest human to complete The Explorers Grand Slam ⁠— a challenge of exceptional prestige that encompasses scaling the highest mountain on each of the seven continents and treks to both the North and South Poles. Not only did he demolish the previous record by an astonishing 53-day margin, along the way he simultaneously broke the 7 Summits world record by two days.Last year, Colin became the first to cross Antarctica solo, unsupported and unaided. Under his own power, Colin pulled a 300-pound sled 932 miles in just 54 days across the coldest, windiest, most remote continent on earth from the Atlantic to the Pacific via the South Pole. It’s a stunning feat of human will that captivated millions — and created controversy along the way.This past December, Colin and five crew mates successfully completed the first and only human-powered ocean row across the Drake Passage ⁠— a treacherous 13-day, 600 nautical mile excursion from the southern tip of South America to the edge of Antarctica ⁠— aptly titled The Impossible Row — chronicled in a mini-series produced by Discovery.Colin’s latest accomplishment coincided with the release of his new book, The Impossible First. Dubbed by Kirkus a “brutally sublime tale of derring-do that transports as well as teaches”, it’s a memoir that chronicles his incredible life and the many lessons learned about human potential, possibility, and the power of infinite love.If you missed our previous conversations (RRP#207, RRP#235 and RRP#439), they’re an excavation of Colin’s origin story growing up on a commune. How he survived an almost lethal burn accident that left him unlikely to walk again. His phoenix-like transformation into a professional ITU triathlete and Olympic hopeful. And how he morphed into a mountaineer with the audacity to attempt such incomprehensible feats of adventure athleticism is well worth the time invested.Today we pick up where our ongoing series last left off.Note: we recorded this conversation many months ago on January 18. My initial plan was to share this episode on February 9. However, on February 2, National Geographic published an article entitled The Problem With Colin O’Brady – a 7,000 word take down that accuses Colin of embellishing his accomplishments.It’s an upsetting piece that left me confused. I’ve known Colin for many years. I’ve spent quite a bit of time with him and his wife Jenna. I consider him a good friend. And myself a decent judge of character. However, in light of this development, it also felt tone deaf to release the podcast as scheduled. So I put a pin it.Two weeks later, Colin published a thorough, 16-page point-by-point refutation of the National Geographic article. I thought it only fair to provide Colin an opportunity to comment on the allegations. So, on March 8 (still pre-pandemic), we sat down again for a subsequent conversation to discuss the controversy particulars.Today I share both conversations. First, the original interview we conducted in January. It’s an exploration the hows and whys behind The Impossible Row. The intention behind his new book and the process of birthing it. And a deep dive into human potential and the infinite love that fuels his.Immediately following this initial exchange is an additional 30-minute discourse specific to the National Geographic scuffle appended to the audio version of the podcast and viewable as a stand-alone piece here & below.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube — where we separated the main podcast conversation and Colin’s thoughts in response to the article into two distinct videos. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.As Colin and I are both fond of repeating, we all sit atop mountains of untapped potential.

May 11, 2020

“Be the person you needed when you were younger.”Chris MosierWith elections looming, the scope of human rights is being hotly debated — and soon to be cast across ballots.In the crosshairs is gender politics — specifically transgender rights — a vital subject of contention I admit to understanding less than I should.So let’s talk about it.To anchor this exploration I reached out to Chris Mosier — arguably the most prominent and accomplished transgender athlete working to progress cultural perceptions and activate legislative change.You may recognize Chris from the viral Nike commercial that aired during the 2016 Rio Olympics. In addition to being the first transgender athlete to be sponsored by Nike, Chris holds the distinction of being the first trans athlete ever to be featured in the ESPN Body Issue.Among his many accomplishments, Chris is a hall of fame triathlete, All-American duathlete, 2-time National Champion, and a 6-time member of Team USA. In 2015 he became the first known transgender man to represent the United States in international competition.More recently, he picked up the sport of race walking and rapidly distinguished himself, becoming the first openly transgender athlete to compete in an Olympic Trials in a category different than their sex assigned at birth.As an activist, Chris has spent years at the forefront of the LGBTQ+ rights movement, paving a more inclusive path for future trans athletes. In 2015, he was the catalyst for changing the International Olympic Committee’s policy on transgender athletes to provide such individuals with the right to represent their country at the Olympic Games. And in 2016, Chris drove further policy change within the IOC, expanding the rights of transgender athletes to take part in the Olympic Games without the previously required necessity of gender reassignment surgery.Profiled everywhere from Rolling Stone to the New York Times, Chris is also the founder of Transathlete.com, a resource for students, athletes, coaches, and administrators to find information about trans inclusion in athletics at various levels of play. He has mentored transgender athletes around the globe, from high school and recreational to the professional levels, and helped teams, leagues, and professional sports leagues create gender-inclusive policies.A conversation long in the making, I first stumbled across Chris’ story in a 2017 short documentary about November Project (‘Showing Up’) in preparation for my sit down with the co-founder Brogan Graham (RRP #277). One of the athletes profiled in the video was Chris. Although previously unfamiliar with his story, I was immediately compelled. Hence began three years of correspondence to bring us to today.Aside from his physical prowess, what impresses me most about Chris is his courage. He had the option to stay silent — to make the most of his passing privilege without enduring the scrutiny that accompanies a public coming out. But he did so to set precedent. To change public perception. And stand as a beacon of hope and possibility for those who will come after him.This is a conversation about Chris’s unique life. His transition. His trials. And his tribulations.It’s about the privileges of gender, race, and class.It’s about what it’s like having your very existence up for debate, and how our country is treating so many of her citizens as non-humans.For context, consider that 41% of trans youth attempt suicide. Horrific and unacceptable, it’s a statistic that must change. Together we can do better. So it is with pride that I share Chris’ story, bravery, and vulnerability with you today.Note: This conversation was recorded pre-pandemic, thus there is no mention of the coronavirus. May this episode provide a significant and thoughtful reprieve from your 24/7 pandemic news feed.And for something new & different: People seemed to enjoy my brief check-in segment with Mishka Shubaly in the lead in to my recent episode with Chris Hauth (RRP #514). So I thought I’d do it again. Today’s appetizer to the main course is Nadia Bolz-Weber — my favorite heavily tattooed Lutheran pastor from RRP #428 — who drops in to talk quarantine, ‘grace for fuckups’ and her fabulous new podcast, The Confessional.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube (except the Nadia part, which is audio only). And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I sincerely hope you find this exchange as revealing and enlightening as I did.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

May 7, 2020

“There is no “us and them” to the coronavirus; we are all just us. It’s a costly lesson, but at this divisive time, it is of great value.”Dr. David KatzThe media fervor currently swirling the pandemic is a fever of conflicting data and performative politics. Black and white, it’s either sequester ad infinitum or back to work now — a conversation devoid of nuance.How to discern fact from fiction? Separate opinion from data? Politics from perspective?Like me, I suspect you’re frustrated — yearning for evidence-based answers over conjecture; considered strategy over confusion; and objectivity over punditry.I can’t tell you when this alternate reality (which has morphed into a distorted normality) will cease. What I can offer is the experience and perception of one of the best and brightest in public health and preventive medicine.Meet David L. Katz, MD, MPH FACPM, FACP, FACLM.A pioneering voice in functional lifestyle medicine, David is a graduate of Dartmouth, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine & Yale School of Public Health. In addition, he is the founding director of Yale University’s Yale-Griffen Prevention Research Center, a past-president of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, and the founder & president of the True Health Initiative, a non-profit coalition of more than 500 world-renowned physicians, scientists, and nutrition experts (including myself, the least qualified member of this coalition) committed to establishing and communicating a growing scientific consensus on the optimal diet for human beings and the planet.The recipient of 3 honorary doctorates, David was also a James Beard Award nominee in 2019 for health journalism, has contributed countless articles to top medical journals along with op-eds in The New York Times and other magazines, and somehow found the time to write 17 books, including his latest, How To Eat, which he co-authored with the great Mark Bittman.Although David has been a prominent voice in nutrition science and lifestyle medicine for many years, the pandemic has suddenly foisted him into a very bright spotlight.Currently making the major media rounds, you might have caught one of his recent appearances on Real Time With Bill Maher, CNN or Fox News, where he’s been advocating for a more data-driven, targeted public health response to coronavirus.It’s a strategy he calls vertical interdiction. It’s (strangely) controversial. And it’s the focus of today’s conversation — a nuanced discourse on improving how we consider and navigate the landmines of this unique global predicament.I appreciate David’s thoughtful perspective and his commitment to service (including treating COVID-19 patients on the outbreak frontlines in the Bronx). He’s eloquent and data-driven. Evidence-based and no-nonsense. And quite charming to boot. To anyone suffering from the virus or the effects of it, my heart goes out to you. This pandemic is hurting us all, some in more catastrophic ways than others.  I hope Dr. Katz’s words bring you comfort — he gets as close as he can to providing us with the answers we are all so desperately seeking.The visually inclined can watch it go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.It’s an honor to share his perspective with all of you today.

May 4, 2020

“Never doubt that one person can make a difference.”INGRID NEWKIRKA true force of nature, today’s guest needs little introduction. Meet Ingrid Newkirk.The original doyenne of animal activism, Ingrid is the legendary and infamous co-founder and president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a non-profit she personally shepherded into the largest animal rights organization in the world, currently boasting more than 6.5 million members and supporters.Under Ingrid’s stewardship, PETA quite literally put animal welfare on the map. Operating under the principle that animals are not ours to experiment on, eat, wear, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way, PETA has a storied and often controversial history of exposing countless acts of gruesome and horrifying animal abuse, with it’s media-savvy provocateur in chief grabbing headlines and creating significant awareness, policy changes and legal protections along the way.Over the years Ingrid has lobbied for animal protection everywhere, from the Canadian Parliament to the streets of New Delhi. She’s behind the first arrest in U.S. history of a scientist on cruelty to animals charges and helped pass the first anti-cruelty law in Taiwan. She worked to end General Motors’ crash tests on animals. And she has persuaded countless fashion companies to drop fur — advancing the vegan cause to millions of people around the world.Named a top businessperson of the year by Forbes, Ingrid has been profiled in countless publications — including twice by The New Yorker — and has appeared in seemingly every prominent media outlet including the Today Show, The Oprah Winfrey Show, Larry King, Politically Incorrect, Crossfire, Nightline, and 60 Minutes.Today Ingrid shares her story.Irrespective of your opinions about PETA, one truth persists: without Ingrid’s relentless persistence, passion, and stewardship, the cultural, legal & regulatory landscape that dictates norms around how we think about and treat animals certainly would not be what it is today.This is someone who has dedicated every breath to what she believes in. Combating injustice. Taking action to change what many of us simply want to deny or avoid. Looking suffering straight in the eye. And doing something about it. That level of purpose — the courage to speak truth to power, tenacity to weather persistent criticism and stay the course for change — is rare. It’s impressive and laudable.Behind it all, there is an undeniable sincerity to Ingrid. A fascinating, complex, and charismatic character, she’s also deeply sensitive. Quite self-aware. And surprisingly funny.Today’s conversation is about the genesis of animal rights activism and the early days of PETA. It’s also about the work that remains, including a deep dive into the particulars of animal lab testing — a subject I freely admit to not knowing as much about as I should.This is also a rumination on Ingrid’s new book, Animalkind — a beautiful primer on what can be learned from the intelligence and emotionally rich lives of our under-appreciated animal friends and why the beings with whom we share this planet deserve our respect.But more than anything, this is a philosophical dissection of belief and values — and how Ingrid’s have indelibly shaped policy and culture around the globe.Note: This conversation was recorded pre-pandemic on February 18, 2020. Therefore there is no coronavirus discussion. However, I think Ingrid’s message is profoundly of the moment given the undeniable role animal agriculture plays in fomenting disease.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.In this moment of forced repose, my hope is that we reflect on humanity’s misguided entitlement to dominion over all things. Our intelligence is not the gauge of the animal kingdom. And our relationship with the living beings with whom we share this imperiled planet is broken.Ingrid is here to recalibrate that relationship.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

April 27, 2020

“As you love yourself, life loves you back.”KAMAL RAVIKANTThe underdog meets unforeseen obstacles. Brought to his knees, he’s compelled to seek deep within. Meeting fate, strength is somehow found in a mystical power greater than himself. He leverages it to evolve into something greater and more authentic. Emerging self-actualized, he then shares his newfound wisdom and experience for the benefit of others.We call it the hero’s journey.Totemic, it’s an indelible archetype that unites, connecting with something universal.Over the years, I’ve hosted many heroes of the physical. From Olympic medalists to arctic explorers, I celebrate the arc of the athletic warrior.But life’s greatest passage isn’t free-soloing El Capitan, crossing Antarctica, or running ultramarathons in Patagonia.Our most challenging voyage is learning how to love ourselves.No one embodies this genus of the hero’s journey better than Kamal Ravikant.Reared from modest beginnings, Kamal has trekked the Himalayas, earned his US Army Infantry patch, walked 550 miles across Spain, and meditated with Tibetan monks in the Dalai Lama’s monastery.Professionally, he’s done it all too. From launching startups to managing venture capital funds, Kamal has spent the better part of his career working alongside some of the smartest investors and engineers in Silicon Valley, writing books in his free time.But Kamal’s most transformative experience has been the simple act of learning how to love himself.This is his story.I first heard about Kamal by way of his frequent appearances on our mutual and beloved friend James Altucher’s podcast.Compelled by his honesty and vulnerability, I felt myself holding space with someone who embodied an important wisdom. A wisdom I lacked. Reflexively, I picked up Kamal’s latest book, Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It.Spiritual and emotional growth is my jam and yet I never thought much about self-love. So I freely admit I met Kamal’s book with a healthy dose of initial skepticism.However, the read ignited a realization that I continue to harbor unhealed wounds. Simple, straightforward and profound, I discovered practices not just helpful, but truly transformative. I wanted to know more.Today we unpack Kamal’s heroic journey of the heart.It’s a conversation about his trials and his triumphs. His divine moment. The path of self-discovery that followed. And what he learned surviving a recent near death experience.It’s about how he learned to love himself. The simple routine he deploys to maintain it. And why this practice is essential to living an examined, self-actualized life of presence, purpose and contentment.For the stoics and skeptics, I implore you to set aside whatever resistance you may be feeling right now. And give this one a shot with an open mind and heart.Note: This conversation was recorded pre-pandemic (February 12, 2020), thus there is no coronavirus reference. Nonetheless, Kamal’s wisdom is timeless. Moreover, the practices we discuss are powerful tools of self-discovery than can prove transformative as we navigate this challenging time.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Kamal’s vulnerability is refreshing. I love this conversation and the friendship it has birthed.

“The athlete’s mindset is the awareness to stay in the moment and do the best you can do with the task at hand — whatever that task may be.”Chris HauthCoronavirus has canceled more than just school, work, and social outings. It’s also canceled sports. The Olympics. And even that race you’ve been training for — gone.The world has huge problems right now. To lament your cancelled marathon, ultra or Ironman feels tone deaf; insensitive to the countless people across the world currently suffering in unimaginable ways.And yet for the athlete, the disappointment is still real. It’s not shameful to experience the emotions that accompany a let down. Just don’t linger there.In this precarious moment, we can’t afford to dwell on a future that will no longer be. And events beyond our control.Instead, let us pull focus on creative solutions for maintaining our enthusiasm for fitness. Strategies to engage with our physical selves. And tactics to ensure adherence to a daily routine with staying power.To dive deeper into the hows and whys of staying fit during quarantine, I’m joined today by Chris Hauth — my friend and trusted sensei of all matters strength and endurance.A two-time Olympian, former professional triathlete, Ironman champion, Age Group Ironman World Champion, and accomplished ultra-athlete, Chris is one of the world’s most respected endurance coaches — and the star act in my recurring Coach’s Corner edition of the podcast.A remarkable coach and lifelong athlete, Chris has honed his craft unlike any other sports professional I have ever met.But my favorite thing about Chris is his attitude. A fount of soothing positivity, he values experience and fun over podiums.This is a conversation about adapting our fitness routines to quarantine. How to maintain healthy home habits in this hectic time. How to reimagine goals. And craft personal adventures in lieu of canceled races.Finally, Chris provides copious tangible takeaways to stay sane for those whose training life has been turned upside down.And for something new & different: An appetizer to precede today’s main course, we also briefly check in with the RRP’s favorite lap dog Mishka Shubaly. To get a little taste for his flavor of quarantine. To celebrate the 7th anniversary of our bromance. And because my self-deprecating, gravelly voiced brother from another mother has a new must-listen Audible Original called Cold Turkey: How To Quit Drinking By Not Drinking.May these exchanges lift your spirits in this bizarre moment we are collectively experiencing.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

April 20, 2020

“Stop chasing better outcomes and start focusing on a better process.”Shane ParrishEvery single day you make about 35,000 decisions.You decide to get up or hit snooze. You decide to challenge yourself or take the back seat. You decide to learn from mistakes, or not.Our lives truly are the sum of our decisions compounded. What we do and what we decide quite literally defines who we are.In this destabilizing moment of fear and uncertainty — when lives quite literally hang in the balance — the nature and quality of our decision making is paramount. It is thus incumbent upon us all, now more than ever, to optimize our decision making skills.So how precisely do we do this?It’s a question that became an obsession for Shane Parrish, a former computer scientist and spy who began to ply his curiosity and copious analytical aptitude to create a canonical roadmap to drive better judgment, better decisions, and ultimately better life outcomes for himself and others.According to Shane, the key is expanding our mental models, the frameworks we craft and rely upon to simplify complexity and understand the world. Prioritizing objective reasoning, mental models help to better frame the decision-making process, putting us in a better position to create relevancy and succeed in life.One of the biggest influencers across Wall Street, Silicon Valley and professional sports, Shane is a former cybersecurity expert for Canada’s version of the NSA and the founder of Farnam Street — a curated collection of research and musings to sharpen your mind, help you make smarter decisions, and ultimately live better.Featured in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and The Economist, Shane also hosts The Knowledge Project podcast (always high in my personal rotation), pens the Brain Food weekly newsletter and is the author of The Great Mental Models Vol. 1: General Thinking Concepts and The Great Mental Models, Volume 2: Physics, Chemistry and Biology — the first two releases in a series of books designed to improve your decision making, productivity, and how clearly you see the world.We begin today’s exchange with Shane’s prior career at Canada’s top intelligence agency. His take on cybersecurity in a  post 9-11 world. And the lessons he learned from his time as a spy.It’s a conversation about the importance of reading and deep learning— training yourself to remember everything you read and how to apply it to your life.And it’s about developing your mind and thought processes to create a competitive advantage.But more than anything, this is a conversation about distilling wisdom into teachable formulae for living a better, more fulfilling, more wholesome life.Because how we decide is how we live.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Note: this conversation was recorded on February 11, 2020 — weeks prior to the alternate reality we find ourselves in today. Therefore, there is no talk about the pandemic. Nonetheless, Shane’s wisdom and experience is both timeless and timely. I suspect you will find this exchange instructive and helpful in navigating the perils of our current situation.If you are interested in Shane’s pandemic related thoughts, he recently penned an excellent piece on Farnam Street entitled What You Truly Value.I’m grateful for this exchange and am better for it. My hope is that you find Shane as dynamic and helpful as I did.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

April 13, 2020

“Running makes you value your time.”Nick ButterCompleting a marathon is a noble accomplishment.How about completing a marathon on every continent? A feat of a lifetime.Now imagine completing a marathon in every single country in the world. Impossible?Meet Nick Butter — an enterprising young Brit who recently reframed human potential, becoming the first person in history to crush 196 marathons in all 196 countries.A world-record setting feat noteworthy for daunting financial and logistical challenges that often dwarfed those athletic, it took Nick and his team two years to plan and 674 days to complete — an astounding accomplishment that entailed running 3 marathons, in 3 new countries a week, every week, for 96 weeks, blowing through 10 passports and 455 flights along the way.More Jason Bourne than Forrest Gump, Nick ran through 15 war zones and endured several Argo-esque border crossings. He was mugged twice and repeatedly attacked by dogs, even going so far as to run 335 laps around a car park on the Marshall Islands to avoid that country’s overrun population of rabid canines. He had his luggage stolen. He ran in extreme cold and unbearable heat, oftentimes starting marathons at two or three in the morning to avoid 140-degree weather. He repeatedly succumbed to food poisoning and kidney infections. This list goes on.But ultimately, Nick prevailed — and learned a few things about life along the way.What drives a man to attempt such a feat? In Nick’s case, it wasn’t fame. It wasn’t notoriety. It was something far greater.In 2016, while enduring Marathon des Sables deep in the Moroccan desert, Nick struck up a friendship with fellow ultrarunner Kevin Webber — a man given just two years to live, courtesy of incurable advanced prostate cancer.Kevin’s courageous life embrace inspired Nick to rethink his career path in finance. Empowered him to tackle an impossible goal. And motivated him to raise funds and awareness for prostate cancer solutions along the way.This is a conversation about the physical, mental, and emotional strength it took to conquer a challenge of breathtaking magnitude.It’s about the obstacles faced and overcome. The lessons learned. And the importance of giving back.It’s about audacious dreams. Unbridled adventure. And the courage required to jump into the unknown without a safety net.But more than anything, this is a conversation about this fleeting, shared experience we call life — and what we can all learn from Nick’s example about ourselves and our place in the world.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Note: This podcast was recorded pre-pandemic (on January 28, 2020).Reminder: I recently created a Facebook Group for fans of the show to to congregate. Click here to join.I think you’re going to fall in love with Nick.

April 9, 2020

“Covid-19 is like a rehab intervention that breaks the addictive hold of normality.”Charles EisensteinIf there is a silver lining to this perilous global moment, it is the opportunity to snap the denial that humans exist separate from each other — and the biosphere that supports all life.Like an addict’s moment of clarity, we are awakening to our intrinsic interconnectedness — with others and the world at large. An epiphany both humbling and beautiful, it is now incumbent to rethink, reimagine, and recreate the story we tell ourselves about who we are — and who we aspire to be.This is an initiation. An opportunity to reset. A call to reclaim our inherent divinity as spiritual beings having a human experience in intimate relationship with every living thing. An opportunity to expand our awareness beyond self-interest and elevate the collective consciousness — so that we can chart a more compassionate, sustainable and community-empowered normal going forward.One of the deepest integrative thinkers active today, today’s guest is a crucial voice in this conversation.Meet Charles Eisenstein.A speaker, writer, and social philosopher focusing on themes of human cultural evolution, economics and consciousness, Charles is the author of several books, including Climate – A New Story, Sacred Economics, The More Beautiful World our Hearts Know is Possible, and The Ascent of Humanity.A graduate of Yale University, where he acquired degrees in both mathematics and philosophy, Charles is a counter-culture intellectual and proponent of alternative political and economic narratives that combine ecology, biology, philosophy & spirituality to challenge our current system.  You can find his essays, videos, courses and podcasts at charleseisenstein.org. Sensitive to the delicacy of this moment, I’ve been very careful about who I invite on the show to discuss it.The pandemic has cast a cosmic panic I am not interested in amplifying. Nor do I feel it appropriate to deliver an empty dose of conjectural optimism.I don’t hold myself out as knowing what exactly is happening. I don’t think any of us do.I can’t give you a prediction or a prescription.What I can offer is perception. Some perspective. And a broader aperture to reckon with the many ramifications of this most unusual global event.Last week I devoured a recent essay by Charles entitled The Coronation. I found it to be one of the most insightful and well-considered long reads to date on how to think expansively about our current moment. It’s a piece that has stayed with me — and the motivation behind today’s exchange.In the vein of my exchanges with Dr. Zach Bush, this is a thoughtful and at times metaphysical conversation about completely redefining our definition of normal.It’s about the potential energy of this shared experience to unite humanity around reinventing society wholesale.It’s about asking questions. It’s about challenging the dominant narrative. Taking a hard look at our institutional failures. And the systems that perpetuate them.As we delicately wade through the muddy waters of media calamity, conspiracy theories, and fake news, this is a conversation about learning how to listen. How to feel. And how to excite the senses around the quiet call that change is actualizing.Without minimizing the severity of what is and what is to come, this truly is our opportunity to cast a new world.May Charles Eisenstein be our gentle steward.Audio Note: This podcast was recorded remotely. Therefore, please excuse the audio quality, a somewhat eroded version of what you’ve come to expect.Facebook Group: I have been remiss in not previously announcing that I recently created a Facebook Group for fans of the show to to congregate.

April 6, 2020

“My purpose is to reduce suffering.”Leah GarcésMeat is complicated. Political, divisive and often polarizing.The most common story focuses on cows. Perhaps the most ethically fraught of farmed animals, red meat production is an environmental disaster. It’s incredibly resource intensive. And linked to an array of human illnesses.A common response? Swap that beef for chicken.America’s favorite meat, chicken constitutes a staggering 95% of all factory-farmed animals. The U.S. currently consumes 9 billion chickens per year with worldwide numbers in the 50 billion range. That’s about 137 million chickens a day. Every day.But is chicken actually healthier than beef? Is it more environmentally responsible or ethical in comparison to other alternatives?Today Leah Garcés joins the podcast with a public service announcement: everything you think you know about chicken is wrong.The new president of the international non-profit Mercy for Animals, Leah Garcés has spent her life on the frontlines of the animal welfare movement exposing what actually transpires inside industrial chicken farms. Devoted to improving conditions for factory-farmed animals, she has made significant progress not through a traditional strategy of antagonism, but instead by pursuit of cooperation, working alongside some of the largest food and agriculture companies in the world — including Perdue, Popeye’s, Panera & Chipotle — to produce positive change.In her new book, Leah chronicles her experience teaming up with whistleblowers in the megafarm industry. Part memoir, part investigative thriller, Grilled: Turning Adversaries into Allies to Change the Chicken Industry is a great read that not only elucidates the ills of our broken food system, but also casts an optimistic lens on a better future for food, animals, and humans.This is a story about empathy. Not just for the animals, but for the people most animal rights folks consider the enemy: the factory-farmers; the slaughterhouse workers; and the corporate executives that control animal intensive farming.Rather than fight against these people, Leah adopted a different approach, working with them instead.It’s a tactic that might strike the hardened animal rights activist as anathema. Controversial and perhaps even unacceptable. But the cornerstone of the vegan movement is compassion. And lasting change can only come from directing that emotion not just to the animals, but to all — including the people behind the animals.Today we unpack all of it.It’s a conversation about the insidious reality of industrial chicken farming. An exploration of the modern-day farmer’s plight as an indentured servant. And the industrial complex that entrenches our broken and undeniable cruel system of food production.But ultimately, this is a conversation about empathy. It’s about practicing what you preach. And the strategies required to create sustainable change to forge a better world for all.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Note: For those who shut down at the mere mention of animal rights, I ask only that you set aside your preconceived judgments. Because this conversation isn’t just about the suffering of animals. It’s about the suffering of people. And it’s about a system that is hoodwinking us all, including the chicken farmer with his boots in the ground.Final Note: this conversation was recorded pre-pandemic on January 31, 2020. Our world has since changed. But given what we are learning about the relationship between large-scale intensive animal farming and the propagation of disease, Leah’s message, experience and wisdom is more relevant now than everI am grateful for Leah’s advocacy and passion.

“If you’re not inspired by life, you’re not paying attention.”IN-QAs we navigate this perilous moment, may we find some sliver of grace. May we reckon with our privilege. Choose beauty and curiosity over rigidity. Compassion and fullness of heart over closed mindedness. And social connection over geographic isolation — even if it be temporarily virtual.Difficult times across history have always resulted in explosions of creative expression. Art as a means of better understanding our shared human condition.Few people embody this ethos more thoroughly than today’s guest, one of my very favorite people breathing air on planet Earth.Generous, present and deeply curious, he goes by the moniker IN-Q.Long-time listeners will fondly recall our two previous sit-downs (RRP #81 & #118 back in 2014) and his appearance at our more recent live event (RRP #473). For those new to the show, prepare to be amazed.IN-Q is a National Poetry Slam Champion, award-winning poet, spoken word artist and multi-platinum songwriter who has shared the stage with everyone from Barack Obama to Eminem. Named to Oprah’s SuperSoul 100 list of the world’s most influential thought leaders, IN-Q is the first spoken word artist to perform with Cirque Du Soleil and has been featured on A&E, ESPN, and HBO’s Def Poetry Jam.Inspiring audiences around the world through his live performances and amazing storytelling workshops, his poetry videos have a habit of going viral, clocking over 70 million views to date.Following in the tradition of some of the world’s great poets, IN-Q crafts verse that not only entertains, but challenges listeners to take a deep look inward to consider their place in the world, their impact on the environment, and to recognize the threads of loss, forgiveness, transformation, and belief that are woven into all of our lives. Today he shares his story, wisdom, and unique gifts.The occasion for this particular conversation is Inquire Within, IN-Q’s long-awaited, wholly original, deeply authentic and inspiring new book.Hitting shelves everywhere this week, the book — and this conversation — is a contemplation of universal issues: love, loss, forgiveness, transformation, and belief.This conversation was recorded pre-pandemic. However, the wisdom is timeless. Shining a light on the shared human condition, IN-Q provides a dynamic lens through which to think about ourselves and the world — something we need now more than ever.Today I shine that light on him. The result is glorious.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. In addition to the two poems performed during the podcast, we also filmed a third poetic performance post-podcast which you can view here. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Provocative, entertaining and refreshingly honest, IN-Q is unlike any other.May his presence, wisdom, experience, and poetry help you reimagine your truth.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Let’s connect humans to be co-creative rather than consumptive.”Zach Bush, MDThe pandemic presents an opportune time to get re-acquainted with Zach Bush, MD.A triple board-certified physician specializing in internal medicine, endocrinology and hospice care, today’s guest is an internationally recognized educator, speaker and authority on all facets of well-being.Focused on the relationship between the microbiome, disease and food production systems, Zach is the founder of Seraphic Group, an organization devoted to developing root-cause solutions for human and ecological health in the sectors of big farming, big pharma, and Western Medicine at largeHe is also the founder of Farmers Footprint, a non-profit coalition of farmers, educators, doctors, scientists, and business leaders aiming to expose the deleterious human and environmental impacts of chemical farming and pesticide reliance — while simultaneously offering a path forward through regenerative agricultural practices to rebuild living biodiversity and ultimately reverse climate change.To me, Zach is a master healer. A man I call friend. And a critical voice in the conversation we need to have in this unprecedented moment of global calamity.Without minimizing the profound severity of our current situation, I cannot overstate the unique opportunity we are being gifted.Like an addict’s moment of clarity, the pandemic presents a singular occasion to break the chains of denial that imprison us. A moment to objectively examine that which no longer serves us. The behaviors that repeatedly lead us astray. An economic system that demands constant growth at the cost of the collective good. A political system that preys on fear to divide. A conglomerated food apparatus that foments disease. A pharmaceutical complex that relies upon that disease to create dependency. And ultimately a collective obsession with ego, power, money, and material consumption that is rapidly eroding our biosphere, degrading our integrity — and separating us from others, ourselves and our innate divinity.I aspire that we emerge from this planetary wake up call not as victims, but empowered — armed with greater clarity to reimagine and actualize a better, more sustainable, purposeful, intentional and fulfilling life experience for ourselves, our loved ones, future generations and frankly the world at large.I can think of few people better equipped to traverse this terrain than Zach, alongside me for his fourth appearance on the show.Well worth your undivided attention, today he shares his unique perspective on the coronavirus epidemic in a conversation that goes behind what is happening. How to best navigate it. And what the pandemic signifies for humanity and the future of planetary ecology.Audio Note: This podcast was recorded remotely. My first since the earliest days of the podcast, I admit a severe allergy to this dynamic. Being physically present with my guest is crucial to providing an optimal listening experience. However, sequestration demands I adapt. So this is my fairly reluctant attempt to do just that. Therefore, please excuse the audio quality, a somewhat eroded version of what you’ve come to expect. Sub-par bandwidth and latency issues impeded our ability to converse as naturally as I would have preferred — more staccato back and forth than my hallmark organic flow.Zach has a knack for landing our podcasts with unmatched profundity. And today he delivers a master class in thinking both deeply and broadly about this unique situation we are collectively experiencing.I love this man. I’m grateful for his wisdom. And I’m proud to share it with you today.

March 23, 2020

“Health comes from healthy living.”Michael Klaper, MDAt the heart of this podcast are evidence-based conversations with leading clinicians at the intersection of nutrition and functional health.Today we honor this long-standing tradition with one of my favorite medical minds.Meet Michael Klaper, MD.For the past 40 years, Dr. Klaper has distinguished himself as a gifted general practitioner, internationally recognized teacher, and sought-after speaker on diet, health, applied plant-based nutrition and integrative medicine.After receiving his medical degree from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago, Dr. Klaper has served in many capacities as a clinician with training in a wide variety of disciplines, including internal medicine, surgery, anesthesiology, orthopedics, obstetrics, and acute care.I became acquainted with Dr. Klaper during his eight-year term at the TrueNorth Health Center in Santa Rosa, California. A nutrition-based medical clinic specializing in therapeutic fasting and health improvement through a whole-food, plant-based diet, TrueNorth is renowned for successfully navigating people to better well-being through non-intervention lifestyle protocols.In addition, Dr. Klaper served as an advisor to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) project on nutrition for long-term space colonists on the moon and Mars. He was also a member of the Nutrition Task Force of the American Medical Student Association and served as the Director of the non-profit Institute of Nutrition Education and Research.Diet is key to reversing many of the most feared degenerative diseases known to medicine. And yet, applied nutrition is not typically integral to medical school curriculums. To solve this problem, Dr. Klaper partnered with PlantPure Communities to form Moving Medicine Forward, a medical school nutrition education initiative designed to change the way future doctors treat their patients through improved nutrition and lifestyle education. The most important work of his career, Dr. Klaper lectures at medical schools nationwide, educating students on using plant-predominant nutrition and positive lifestyle changes to truly heal their patients — and ultimately improve the health of future generations.Early in his career, Dr. Klaper realized that many of the diseases his patients brought to his office were made worse, or actually caused by the high-fat, high sugar, overly processed Standard American Diet.When he began treating his patients not with pharmaceuticals and surgical interventions but instead with diet and lifestyle protocols — specifically a whole-food, plant-based diet and active lifestyle — he started getting unprecedented results.Over time, he observed his patients miraculously reverse a litany of chronic ailments, including atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, hypertension, obesity, adult onset diabetes, and even some forms of arthritis, asthma, and autoimmune disease.Today Dr. Klaper shares his wisdom and experience, picking up where we left off in our first podcast conversation, published six years ago to the day (RRP #77).We discuss his mission to help empower the next generation of doctors to better heal their patients. And we explore his dream of eradicating the chronic lifestyle epidemics that unnecessarily afflict millions of people every single year.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.The most energetic and youthful 72-year old I’ve ever met, I aspire to this beautiful and gentle man’s enthusiasm for life and commitment to service.Note: Taped in late January, today’s episode is one of many (14 total) conversations I recorded pre-pandemic. My current intention is to continue releasing such episodes in accordance with my regular schedule. However, I will also be publishing supplemental mid-week episodes to address our current unique situation contemporaneously.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.In the meantime, stay safe everyone.

“Restriction kindles creativity; and crisis the opportunity for growth.”Rich RollA diversion from my typical format, today I sit down with my wife Julie Piatt to discuss the coronavirus pandemic.For those unfamiliar, Julie is an accomplished yogi, healer, musician, and mom to our four children. She is the author of three bestselling vegan cookbooks and hosts both the For The Life of Me podcast and Water Tiger, her online spiritual community. In addition, she is the founder and ‘Mother Arc’ of SriMu, her recently launched plant-based cheese start-up.This is a conversation about exercising care and self-care as we delicately wade through these most unprecedented waters.It’s about replacing fear, anxiety and uncertainty with acceptance. Surrender. Creativity. Faith. And self-inquiry.It’s about navigating calamity with grace. Finding the opportunity in crisis.It’s about leaning into what is to reflect more deeply on our lives. And mindful response over reflexive reaction.And finally, it’s about seizing sequestration to contemplate a better path forward for ourselves, future generations, and the planet.Without minimizing the severity of what is and what is to come, may we come together now — in this virtual space — to grow.Because we’re in this together. And together we are stronger.As always, subscribe and listen on Apple Podcasts and Spotify and you can also listen on YouTube (Audio Only). May you find comfort in this exchange.Peace + Plants,Theragun: To experience the deep muscle massager that’s unlike anything you’ve ever felt — risk-free for 30 days or your money back— visit theragun.com/richroll.  For a limited time, my listeners can get a FREE charging stand with purchase — a $79 dollar value.Gravity Blankets: The top-rated weighted blanket, this product literally changed my life — helping me fall asleep faster and keep me asleep longer.

“They were so many things to me, those pills — fuel, an escape, and eventually a necessity — but medication was not one of them.”DAN PERESEvery day, over 130 people in the U.S. die from an opioid overdose.About one quarter of all patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain misuse them — that’s 10.3 million people.And about 80% of people who use heroin first misused prescription opioids.Think about that.A tragic epidemic of untold proportions, opioid addiction has precipitated a massive public health crisis, destroying millions of lives unnecessarily while taxing our economy at the rate of $78.5 billion per year.How did we get here? In the late 1990’s big pharmaceutical companies starting pushing the powerful pills on healthcare providers as panaceas for pain, with the reassurance that patients would not become addicted. Nonetheless, widespread misuse ensued, leading millions of Americans to suffer profound substance abuse disorders — decimating lives, families and communities along the way.Today I share one man’s journey into the depths of opioid addiction despair — what happened, what it was like, and how he ultimately found a way out.His name is Dan Peres — and it’s quite the story.Hardly a born media insider, Dan was an awkward, magic-obsessed adolescent. But his gift for the written word and shrewd eye for culture catapulted him to premature heights in the fast-paced world of glossy magazine publishing. At 24, he was covering catwalks in Paris as the European editor for W magazine. A few short years later he landed the coveted editor gig at Details magazine, the arbiter of all things cool and zeitgeist — a post he held for 15 years.Along the way Dan nurtured a secret, seeking refuge in opioids to a salve profound imposter syndrome as he navigated the high-voltage netherworld of fashion designers, celebrities and media moguls.Like so many, it’s a relationship that began with a back injury and a prescription. A love affair that escalated to 60 pills a day, betrayal soon followed. A best friend that turned dark. And an addiction that took him places he never thought he would go, produced more instances of incomprehensible demoralization than he cares to remember, and eroded the moral fabric of his life.By a power greater than himself, Dan found a way out. Now 12 years sober, he recollects the vivid details of his experience in As Needed For A Pain — a harrowing and at times humorous coming-of-age tale that offers a rare glimpse into New York media’s past (a time when print magazines mattered), dissects a life teetering on the edge of destruction, and chronicles what it took to pull back from the brink of an addiction that very nearly killed him.Today Dan shares his powerful tale from depravity to salvation.Even if the opioid epidemic hasn’t affected you directly, chances are someone in your life suffers. May this conversation open your eyes. Help you better understand the cunning, baffling and powerful nature of this disease. And provide hope to those that currently suffer — because there is a solution.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on  YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.If you need help, seek out an A.A. meeting in your area here. Or call the Substance Abuse And Mental Health Services national helpline at 1-800-662-HELP.Thanks to my friends Amy Dresner (RRP #341) and Jeff Gordinier (RRP #453) for introducing me to Dan.

“The more things for which you develop a fondness the richer the life you live.”Dan BuettnerChances are you’ve heard the term Blue Zones, coined in reference to five hidden slivers of the world that boast the highest per capita populations of centenarians — people who thrive to 100 and beyond.Places where people forgot to die.This is the work of Dan Buettner.A true renaissance man, Dan is a National Geographic Fellow, longevity expert and world explorer with 3 endurance cycling world records to his name. A multiple New York Times bestselling author, he’s a seemingly constant presence on the TODAY show, has appeared on Oprah twice and has been profiled on every respected global media outlet, from CNN to David Letterman.Over the last decade Dan has delivered more than 500 keynotes, including speeches for Bill Clinton’s Health Matters Initiative, Google Zeitgeist, and TEDMED. His TED Talk “How to live to be 100+” has been viewed over 4 million times.The Blue Zones Kitchen is Dan’s latest New York Times bestseller. Technically a cookbook with over 100 recipes inspired by decades of research studying Blue Zones cultures, Dan elevates the genre with extraordinary photography and an anthropologist’s lens on the specific foods, cooking methods and lifestyle practices proven to increase longevity, wellness, and mental health.In addition, Dan is the founder of Blue Zones Project, a community well-being improvement initiative designed to help people live longer and better through community transformation programs that lower healthcare costs, improve productivity, and boost national recognition as great places to live, work, and play.Long time listeners will remember Dan’s podcast debut (RRP #139), where we explored Dan’s adventurous backstory, his fascination with longevity and the research behind all things Blue Zones. Our second conversation (RRP #323) focused on the nature of not only living long, but living well — a dissection of the habits and practices that produce that which we seek most — happiness.Today we synthesize all of it in a primer on how to live a long and fulfilling life.Not surprisingly, it begins with food. It extends to building better communities. It’s underscored by finding purpose. And sharing what you’ve learned for the betterment of others.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Hero, friend and mentor, Dan is a true visionary whose life and work has positively, permanently and quite unequivocally improved the well being of millions.I love this man.

March 5, 2020

“When the heart is true, the Universe will conspire to support you.”Rich RollNow for something a little different.What it was like. What happened. And what it’s like now.Moments shared. Lessons learned. And the growth that remains.For those new to me, 13 years ago found me utterly disconnected from my higher self. After many years lost in the throes of alcohol, I had managed the sober road to happy destiny for nearly a decade. And yet, on the cusp of turning 40, I awoke to find myself in an existential crisis. Stuck in a career that never served me. Unhealthy. Overweight. And totally blind to the path forward.Through a grace more powerful than myself, I found a way out. It’s a journey that began with faith. Evolved through nutrition & fitness. Matured through service. And ultimately has taken me to heights I previously thought unimaginable. It could be said that I reinvented myself wholesale. And transformed others’ lives in the process.Along the way, I’ve experienced success and failure. High highs. Low lows. And growth at the cost of more missteps than I care to admit.Today I am greatly privileged to live a life beyond my wildest imagination. And yet I am often oblivious to this fact, lost in myopia about the work that remains. The stones yet unturned. The character defects that continue to arise. And the past mistakes left uncorrected.I need to be reminded that on occasion it’s important to stop. Honor the path you have blazed. And express gratitude for those in your life that have supported you.Because nobody achieves dreams alone.When Outside Magazine reached out to me last fall to express interest in featuring me on the cover of their January issue, I was convinced I misheard. Unlike so many of my heroes who have graced the cover of this iconic publication, I’m not an Olympic champion or world-class adventurer. I’ve never won a big race. None of my books have ever made a bestseller list. And my podcast is hardly the largest.As surreal as it continues to sound, somehow I did end up on that cover. I could feign ‘low key’. But the honest truth is that it was a very proud moment. An honor I receive with gratitude. A symbol for the many difficult choices I have made. And the faith I was compelled to endure with a whopping dose of humility.Alongside this honor was the opportunity to be a guest on the Outside Podcast. It’s an interview conducted by Peter Vigneron (who penned my Outside cover profile) that was in turn beautifully produced, written, and edited by Michael Roberts with music by Robbie Carver.Over the years, I’ve had the honor to guest on many of the world’s top podcasts. I’ve been on Joe Rogan twice (JRE #642 & #266) and other great programs like Impact Theory, Good Life Project, School of Greatness, Gary Vee, Adam Carolla, Chase Jarvis, James Altucher and many others.I’ve never repurposed any of those experiences on this feed.But this conversation distinguishes itself. A beautiful meditation that best captures how I think about the path I’ve blazed. And what can be gleaned from lessons learned for the benefit of others.So I’m doing what I’ve never done before, resharing that conversation with you here today.Thank you Michael, Peter and everyone at Outside for sharing my story. And special thanks to photographer Beau Grealy for his cover image and the wonderful portraits that accompanied that article and this episode. All of it means more than you know.If you’re stuck in your version of my past and can’t see the way forward, my hope is that this conversation will help spark a shift in perspective that will inspire you to think more openly about possibility. Embolden you to embark upon your version of what I have been blessed to experience. And bring life to the more self-actualized, authentic self within.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“The only limits to human capability are those we impose on ourselves.”Mel UrieOver the last few months, I’ve had the privilege of hosting an impressive litany of powerhouse women breaking paradigms across a wide swath of disciplines.Mel Urie has more than earned her spot amongst these boundary crushers.Devoted listeners will recall Mel’s first appearance on the show (RRP 421 along with fellow endurance fiend Danielle Grabol) to discuss becoming the first two females to ever complete EPIC5 — a race I helped pioneer that involves completing 5 ironman-distance triathlons on the 5 Hawaiian Islands in just 5 days.But then Mel had to go and just completely outdo herself (and embarrass the rest of us) by becoming the first female to not only attempt but to actually complete the fatally absurd ultra-endurance fever dream known as Uberman — a 556-mile self-supported freak fest Outside magazine dubbed “The World’s Hardest Endurance Race”.Kicking off with a brutal 21-mile swim from the island of Catalina to the Southern California mainland — a feat most swimmers can only dream of accomplishing — athletes then endure a 2-day, 400-mile bike ride from Los Angeles to the edge of a barren desert, climbing 20,000-feet before descending into Badwater Basin, the hottest and lowest point in North America.Ready to kick up your feet and crack a cold one? Not so fast. The celebration comes only after lacing up the running shoes and facing down the Badwater 135 course. Considered the world’s most difficult footrace, it entails a quick 135-mile run across Death Valley and up a good portion of Mt. Whitney.Mel didn’t just survive this endeavor. She absolutely crushed it, completing the course in stunning fashion under 136 hours.This is a conversation about Uberman of course — why Mel wanted it, what happened and what she learned doing it.But more than anything, this is a master class on mental toughness.It’s about putting limiting beliefs in the grave.And it’s about what it means to live a ‘No Excuse’ life.This one isn’t just for women. And it’s not just for athletes or those interested in exploring the world of mind-bending endurance sports.This one is for anyone and everyone looking to break the glass ceiling on human potential.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.This stubbornly courageous woman deserves far more credit for her accomplishments than the media has delivered to date. I feel an obligation to change that.May her testimony leave you inspired to finally put your excuses in the rearview.

February 24, 2020

“Numbers don’t mean anything when it comes to success.”Sadie LincolnFrom the moment the alarm jars you awake, life is a harried rush. Commuting, coffee, e-mails, meetings and take out. Getting Jenny to soccer practice and Billy back from theatre. When you finally land home, you’re too beat to move. So you crash on the couch and doze off with a pint. Rinse and repeat.We all do the best we can. But the pressures of daily life can leave us stressed and exhausted. Sedentary and stiff, our shoulders slump. Our spine rounds and our stance is lopsided. Without corrective action, we can’t function properly. And everything we do — including exercise — only exacerbates the problem.Let’s just say Sadie Lincoln can relate. When her career with a global fitness brand almost broke her, she knew something had to change.Sadie and her husband Chris quit their jobs and downsized their lives to pursue an idea most said was bat shit crazy.Hence was born barre3, a fitness company focused not on weight loss but rather on body positivity and personal empowerment.What started as a personal workout blossomed into a daily practice embraced by millions. Since its 2008 inception, barre3 has grown to more than 140 franchise studios powered by female entrepreneurs, plus an online-workout streaming-subscriber base in 98+ countries.Sadie is on Inc. magazine’s Female Founders 100 list, has been featured on NPR’s How I Built This, and speaks regularly on the topics of mindful leadership, the power of body wisdom and the movement to redefine what success in fitness means.Today she shares her story.If you enjoyed my conversation with WeWork co founder Miguel McKelvey from July 2019 (RRP #452), then you may recall Miguel’s untraditional upbringing — collectively raised by his mom and her small group of friends he called ‘aunties’.Sadie grew up in that very same community. Although not genetically related, Sadie and Miguel nonetheless consider themselves brother and sister. So, we talk about that.We discuss how Sadie’s love of motion, creativity and teaching informs her particular strain of entrepreneurship and activism.We talk about what it means to not just create a business — but a movement. The importance of serendipity in the world of fitness. And why physical balance also requires spiritual balance.Finally, we explore Sadie’s commitment to empowering women. To cultivating their voices. And sharing their stories.But more than anything, this is a conversation about the importance of defining your values. Staying true no matter what. And creating the change you want to see in yourself and the world — even if it requires risking everything.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.If you enjoyed my conversation with Kelly McGonigal, you’re going to love Sadie.May you find this conversation as enlightening and transformative as I did.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

February 20, 2020

“Resistance is always lying and always full of shit.”John Joseph500 EPISODES.Over seven years ago, I sat down in a damp and echo-y warehouse on the north shore of Kauai and hit record for the very first time.There was no agenda. No commitment to even record a second episode. And certainly zero idea that what began as a fun experiment would evolve into both a passion and a vocation.And yet here we are. Without fail, beginning in late 2012, I have uploaded at least one episode every single week, amassing over 1000 hours of conversation and a global audience that downloads this show more than 3 million times a month — in total, over 70 million streams and counting.The numbers are great, but they fail to capture what is truly meaningful: the opportunity to go deep and unfiltered with some of the most amazing people currently walking planet Earth; and in turn share their incredible wisdom with all of you.Today I give thanks for taking this journey with me — a calling and a service I consider the best job in the world. It’s been a privilege — a great honor and a profound responsibility I don’t take lightly.I believe in celebrating milestones. So today we do just that. And we do it in style with two of my most most beloved brothers from other mothers.Enter John Joseph and Mishka Shubaly.Between these two gentlemen, I count 14 total previous appearances on the show, including one vivid episode five years past (RRP #95) that involved the three of us huddled on a small bed in a cramped New York City hotel room.Today we fertilize our bromance, reprising those sweet sweet punk rock, Algonquin table vibes with another turntable spin on plants & punk. On running and writing. And on addiction & sobriety. For those new to the show, beloved brother John Joseph is the product of an almost impossible-to-imagine hard boiled upbringing. Born into abuse and reared on the mean streets of Manhattan’s Lower East Side, John spent his youth in and out of foster care. Struggling to simply survive, it’s a life marred by violence, homelessness, drugs, addiction, crime and prison. Ultimately music saved his life — and gave him an entirely new one. Best known for fronting the legendary hard core band Cro-Mags, today John lives a life of sobriety, PMA (positive mental attitude) and ahimsa — non-violence.A Bhakti-yoga devotee, John is also an 11-time Ironman finisher (2 of which he completed with a hernia), motivational speaker, and author of three books: Evolution of a Cro-Magnon, Meat Is For Pussies, and The PMA Effect. Now 57, he continues to ferociously tour, perform, write, speak and serve his fellow man — all fueled on a 100% plant-based diet.I can’t think of a better way to describe little brother Mishka other than stubborn. If you’ve been a listener since day one, then this gravelly voiced, self-deprecating creative should ring a warm bell for you. A cult singer-songwriter and obstinate van dwelling vagabond, Mishka is no stranger to getting in his own way. But he’s also a master storyteller. Lauded for his beguiling tales of drink, drugs, disasters, desire, deception, and their aftermath, he somehow landed a post at Yale University, where apparently students pay money and attention to hear what he has to say about creative writing.Best known for his many chart topping Kindle Singles, I first came across Mishka by way of The Long Run, a short story that quite annoyingly continues to outsell Finding Ultra. His memoir, I Swear I’ll Make It Up To You is a beautiful and touching chronicle of talent, addiction, pain and redemption. And Mishka’s latest work, almost too predictably titled This Van Could Be Your Life, is your next must read.This one is all over the place. No point in even trying to describe it other than that Mishka showed up with a bottle of Pepto Bismol. Kinda says it all.Heads Up: This conversation is packed with expletives. It might even hold the RRP f-bomb record. As many of you know, these laddies simply can’t be muzzled, nor would you want them to be. So just an alert that this episode is neither family friendly nor workplace approved. So pop on the earbuds if you got kiddos in the backseat. And If you’re easily offended, perhaps this one isn’t your cup of tea.500 episodes. It feels good. So good, I wore a coat and tie to mark the occasion, which you can of course watch on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Here’s to celebrating with those you love dearly.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

February 17, 2020

“The disconnect between the research and what the public believes and understands is mind boggling.”Dr. Cyrus Khambatta, PhD & Robby Barbaro, MPHA full blown epidemic in the developed world, diabetes currently afflicts an astonishing 30 million people in the US alone, despite the fact that 1 out of 4 don’t even know they have it.Even more bewildering, over one-third of all U.S. adults have prediabetes. That’s more than 84 million people, 90% of whom are unaware of their condition.Not enough? Over the last 20 years, the number of adults diagnosed has more than doubled, with no end in sight.For purposes of clarity, 90-95% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes are the Type 2 form. The good news is that Type 2 isn’t just treatable, it’s actually reversible — often to the point of undetectability. And for those suffering from Type 1, certain diet and lifestyle changes render the illness more manageable than ever.To learn more about the nature of diabetes, how to avoid it and the many things you can do if you have it, I sat down with Cyrus Khambatta, PhD and Robby Barbaro, MPH — the team behind Mastering Diabetes, an online coaching platform for people living with all forms of diabetes that focuses on low-fat, plant-based, whole-food nutrition. Living with Type 1 diabetes since 2002, Cyrus received a degree in mechanical engineering from Stanford University and a PhD in nutritional biochemistry from UC Berkeley. In addition, he has co-authored many peer-reviewed scientific publications. Robbie has a master’s degree in public health from American Public University, spent six years helping build Forks Over Knives, and has been living with type 1 diabetes since 2000. Experts in the science of insulin resistance, together they have successfully helped thousands prevent, navigate and reverse diabetes not by way of medication, but rather through simple changes in diet and lifestyle — all principles beautifully chronicled in their new book, aptly titled Mastering Diabetes — hitting bookstores February 18.Current medical dogma urges a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet for anyone suffering from diabetes or prediabetes.But is this actually true?Today Cyrus & Robby put this paradigm to the test.While it is true that a low carb approach may improve short-term blood glucose control, such a diet also increases the long-term risk for an array of chronic diseases.Although it may sound counter-intuitive, perhaps even radical, the hard science is ironically quite clear: eating a high carbohydrate, low fat, plant-based whole-food diet rich in fruit (yes, fruit) and vegetables is actually the most powerful way to reverse insulin resistance in all types of diabetes — while also simultaneously preventing a litany of chronic disorders typically linked to today’s popular low-carb approach.Whether or not you have diabetes, chances are you care for someone who does. For those who fall into this category, I truly believe that this conversation is potentially life-saving.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I appreciate the work these two young men are doing to positively impact a disease that unnecessarily debilitates millions. It’s an honor to share their message.

February 10, 2020

“Your genes are not your destiny.”David Sinclair, PhDAging is inevitable. Everybody grows old. Everyone dies.We accept these statements as fact.But what if they’re just stories based on history and our current understanding of biology?What if everything we think we know about aging is about to change?Across the globe, scientists are working on treatments and therapies that are designed to extend healthy human lifespans well beyond what we know today.At the bleeding edge of such breakthroughs you will find David Sinclair, PhD, one of the world’s leading scientific authorities on longevity, aging and how to slow its effects.Returning for his second appearance on the podcast, David is a professor in the Department of Genetics and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School. He obtained his Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics at the University of New South Wales, Sydney in 1995 and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at M.I.T. where, among other things, he co-discovered the cause of aging for yeast.The co-founder of several biotechnology companies, David is also co-founder and co-chief editor of the journal Aging. His work has been featured in a variety of books, documentaries, and media, including 60 Minutes, Nightline and NOVA. He is an inventor on 35 patents, has been lauded as one of the Top 100 Australian Innovators, and made TIME magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world.In addition, David is the author of Lifespan: The Revolutionary Science of Why We Age — and Why We Don’t Have To — a New York Times bestseller that proposes a radical new theory of aging. As he writes: “Aging is a disease, and that disease is treatable.”Last year I convened my first conversation with David (RRP #436), a scintillating and science-heavy primer on all things human lifespan, aging and longevity. It was a runaway hit with the listeners — and left me wanting to know more.So today we pick up where we last left off, diving deeper into the physiological mechanisms that contribute to biological degeneration. And we go further into the current state of research to better understand what contributes to aging and what can be done to counteract it.Call him a dreamer, but David believes living to 200+ is a plausible reality. If you could double your lifespan, how would this impact how you choose to live? What would it mean for the future of humanity? And for the ecological stability of the planet? The implications are profound.Equal parts philosophic and scientific, this conversation will forever change the way you think about why you age and what you can do about it. And it will leave you armed with simple lifestyle practices — such as intermittent fasting, cold exposure, exercising with the right intensity, and eating less meat — you can deploy to live younger and healthier for longer.Brilliant and lovely, it’s an honor to once again share this man’s wisdom with you today. So break out that pen and paper, because you’re going to want to take notes on this one.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I sincerely hope you enjoy the episode.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

February 6, 2020

“Never compromise health in the name of beauty.”Gregg RenfrewThis show spends a lot of time exploring the health, environmental and ethical implications of the food we eat.But what we put on our bodies is just as important as what we put in our bodies.Today we shift gears to explore how vastly uninformed most of us are when it comes to the consequences caused by the innumerable products we slather daily on our largest organ: our skin.You might be surprised to learn that approximately 84,000 chemicals currently find their way into commercial products — with over 1,500 new chemicals released annually. Despite evidence of health harms, most of these chemicals have not been adequately tested for their impact on humans. Nonetheless, many of them find their way into a wide and problematic array of skincare, beauty and cleaning products.Moreover, due to laws that haven’t been updated in 80 years, I was shocked to discover that the Food and Drug Administration — the regulatory authority charged with ensuring the safety of such products — doesn’t necessarily screen product ingredients for safety. In fact, it provides very little oversight when it comes to what ends up in beauty products. Worse yet, the FDA has zero authority to recall products even in the event of a proven harm.When entrepreneur Gregg Renfrew learned that the US has not passed any major legislation about the safety of ingredients in personal care products since 1939, she became determined to make the business of beauty better. Hence was born Beautycounter — a market disrupting, direct-to-consumer line of cleaner, safer skincare products and cosmetics that made Fast Company’s 2019 list of the 50 most innovative companies.Gregg’s been at the helm of Beautycounter since its 2011 inception, driven by a desire to provide toxic-free fare and greater economic opportunity for women. In addition to overseeing 150 employees and 40,000 consultants, Gregg is also a ferocious fixture on Capitol Hill, where she lobbies relentlessly for cosmetic industry reform. And she somehow does it all while remaining a present and involved mom to three of the most incredible kids I have ever met.Her ultimate goal? Overhauling the archaic laws that currently govern her industry — so we can all be beautifully clean.Similar to a handful of past podcast guests, I struck up a friendship with Gregg in 2018 at The Nantucket Project. Over the last year and a half, I’ve had the privilege of observing her in action — at work, on stage, and at home. Let’s just say it’s all very impressive.Today she shares her story.It’s a conversation about an entrepreneurial journey that humbly began with cleaning houses before founding Wedding List — a company she built and later sold, leading to lessons learned working tricky stretches under powerful women like Martha Stewart and Susie Hilfiger.It’s about the experience that motivated her to start Beautycounter, and the unorthodox decisions that followed. Like the 1,500 potentially harmful ingredients she vowed never to use in her products — dubbed The Never List, it was recently updated to 1,800 ingredients. And the choice to eschew traditional retail for a direct-to-consumer business model driven by a network of independent consultants.But more than anything, this is a powerful primer on the perils of conventional beauty products that will leave you completely rethinking what you put on your body (and your children’s bodies) — and well armed to make more educated decisions about the companies and products you patronize going forward.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Gregg is a true force of nature. And this conversation is a gift. May you receive it with gratitude.P.S. Special thanks to Gregg for letting me occasionally kidnap her husband Mark, my new best friend and go to workout partner. I promise to bring him back from Ötillö Catalina in one piece (but in truth I think it’s Mark that needs to worry about bringing me back intact).P.P.S. Beautycounter just released an incredible short documentary entitled Transparency: The Truth About Mica about the problematic nature of this ingredient, widely used in cosmetics.

February 3, 2020

“We can all connect over food and a love of the outdoors.”Iliana ReganLast week we explored the intersection of art and endurance with Rickey Gates.The week prior we broke barriers in women’s sports with Lauren Fleshman and Lindsay Crouse.Today we go deeper on both themes. Not through the lens of running, film or journalism. Our vehicle for this occasion is food and literature.Meet Iliana Regan.The Rickey Gates of cuisine, think Lauren Fleshman with a knife.Much like Rickey, today’s guest is also that rare human blessed with talents that span multiple disciplines. And like both Lauren and Lindsay, her success required the fortitude to stand up for herself in an industry dominated by men.A self-taught chef and author, Iliana has faced and overcome a litany of obstacles from substance abuse to sexual discrimination, ultimately prevailing to experience a special moment right now — celebrated for both her culinary and literary accomplishments.At 15 Iliana landed her first restaurant gig washing dishes and never looked back. Leaning on the rustic experiences of her Midwestern upbringing (she was making mushroom tea long before Four Sigmatic was a thing), Iliana pioneered a unique locavore style of cooking dubbed ‘new gatherer’, plied daily at her Chicago restaurant Elizabeth — notable for its homestead aesthetic, emphasis on foraged foods and deep connection to the natural surroundings.It’s an approach that landed her a coveted Michelin star six years in a row. Jeff Gordinier, food and drinks editor for Esquire magazine (and former podcast guest), included Elizabeth on his recent list of the last decade’s 40 most important restaurants. Noma’s René Redzepi, arguably the world’s greatest chef, counts himself a fan. And David Chang dubs Iliana one of the best chefs he has ever known.This past summer Iliana published Burn The Place. A singular, powerfully expressive debut memoir, her story is raw like that first bite of wild onion, alive with startling imagery, and told with uncommon emotional power. The New York Times describes the book as, “perhaps the definitive Midwestern drunken-lesbian food memoir.” The New Yorker echoes this sentiment, calling it “brutal and luminous”; and “a thrilling, disquieting memoir of addiction and coming of age.” It’s also the first food book to be long-listed for the National Book Award since Julia Child in 1980.Now 10 years sober, Iliana’s passion has made an unlikely turn. Focused not in the predictable direction of building a culinary empire, her sights are instead set on a remote corner of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. Deep in the Hiawatha National Forest, Iliana, alongside her wife Anna and three dogs, has converted a cabin on 150 acres into Milkweed Inn — a bed and breakfast where she serves up her trademark ‘new gatherer’ cuisine to small groups of just 10 people over weekends between May and October.Today Iliana shares her story.It’s a deeply personal conversation about her love of food, foraging and the great outdoors.It’s about identity and sexual politics. How a little girl who longed to be a boy navigated childhood growing up gay in an intolerant community.It’s about alcoholism and the usual stuff that comes with it. Like running away from cops in handcuffs. Having sex in bar bathrooms. And using car keys to bump cocaine.And it’s about sobriety. How Iliana ultimately transformed into a phenom of knife and pen, celebrated for both her literary and culinary talents. And a woman who has made an indelible mark as a pioneer of ‘new gatherer’ cuisine in an industry dominated by men.As an aside, I implore all of you to read Kim Severson’s recent and fantastic New York Times profile on Iliana entitled, After Culinary and Literary Acclaim, She’s Moving to the Woods.Final note of gratitude to Jeff Gordinier for introducing me to Iliana.

January 27, 2020

“Fun over fast. That’s generally what I tell people.”Rickey GatesThere are athletes. There are artists. Rare is the individual that inhabits the best of both worlds.Meet Rickey Gates.Both idiosyncratic and extraordinary, you may know Rickey as a distinguished ultra-runner. But peer just beneath the surface of his many athletic accomplishments and you will discover a thoughtful, deeply empathetic and uniquely expressive human.After nearly a decade competing on the national and international mountain, trail and ultra running circuits, Rickey took his love for endurance, storytelling, photography and design — and fused them together to create an ongoing series of project-based, performance art adventures that go well beyond the bib.Deemed “the rambling poet of the running world” by Outside magazine, Rickey is a true conceptual artist — leveraging numerous mediums to communicate a personal and humanist perspective on the inner workings of society, self, nature and human potential.Notable ventures include his solo, unsupported run across America. The upcoming, exquisite and arresting feature film Transamericana that chronicles it. And his debut book Cross Country that travels inside Rickey’s 3,700 mile journey through over 200 photographs, stories of individuals and ultimately the innermost depths of his own mind. Hitting shelves April 14, 2020, the book is available for pre-order here.In addition, and the project he is perhaps best known for, in 2018 Rickey ran every single street in the city of San Francisco. A feat as logistically challenging as it was athletic, the 1,300 mile undertaking involved running 30 miles every day for 46 days, along the way logging 150,000 feet of elevation gain and meeting countless fascinating people along the way. A master stroke of creative movement, it’s a statement that grabbed headlines around the world. Underscored the importance of human connection. Symbolized the value of community. Celebrated human potential. And in turn, inspired countless people to mimic in their own respective cities.I implore all of you to check out Every Single Street, a beautiful short film produced by Salomon that perfectly captures the spirit of this endeavor.In between his feats of artistic and endurance grandeur, Rickey hosts adventure running retreats called Bus Run Bus and Hut Run Hut, with a trail run adventure retreat in Japan scheduled for September 2020.What strikes me most is Rickey’s profound empathy for people. His curiosity about the world. His poetic lens on the human condition. And his multi-disciplinarian vision for a better more unified world.Running’s Jack Kerouac, it’s not often you encounter a human as present, thoughtful, and creative as Rickey. A man who reminds me that we can all connect more profoundly with our natural environments and communities. Express ourselves more authentically. And love more deeply.Today, Rickey shares his story. And it is an absolute gift.I encourage you to watch it all go down on YouTube, as we weave in footage from Rickey’s cross-country run and the upcoming film Transamericana. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.My hope is that this conversation will leave you deeply touched — and better than before.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

64,Lindsay Crouse,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/lindsay-crouse-494/,"Episode 494
January 23, 2020

“If we really care about the future of girls in sports, we need to invest in the girls that are actually playing these sports.”Lindsay CrouseA perfect companion piece to my recent conversation with Lauren Fleshman — and in furtherance of better understanding the issues that swirl around gender, sport and fairness — today I sit down with an investigative journalist breaking some of the biggest stories in women’s sports.Meet Lindsay Crouse.A graduate of Harvard University, where she competed in both cross country and track and field, Lindsay is a senior staff editor and senior OpDocs producer at The New York Times. If you’ve been paying any attention to running news (or just big headlines in general) then you are already familiar with Lindsay’s work. At the epicenter of the conversation that surrounds sports and power, Lindsay is behind some of the biggest sports stories and opinion pieces in recent memory, with a particular focus on the role and state of women’s distance running.Some of Lindsay’s most popular pieces include How The ‘Shalane Flanagan Effect’ Works, which examined the former podcast guest and New York City Marathon victor’s elevating impact on other women; she broke the story on Nike’s refusal to guarantee female athletes’ salaries during or immediately post-pregnancy; and she produced the piece in which Allyson Felix told her story around Nike and pregnancy.Lindsay also worked with last week’s guest Lauren Fleshman on her powerful November Op-Ed, I Changed My Body For My Sport. No Girl Should and is responsible for the bombshell opinion piece about the emotional abuse suffered by Mary Cain under her former coach, Alberto Salazar. I Was The Fastest Girl in America, Until I Joined Nike created such a stir, it went on to become the 42nd most read New York Times piece for all of 2019.In her role as a senior producer of OpDocs, Lindsay’s many credits include the wonderful film about minimalist marathoner Memo and Walk, Run, Cha Cha, which was recently lauded with an Academy Awards nomination in the documentary short subject category.In addition, Lindsay is an accomplished athlete in her own right. With 12 marathons under her belt, she recently posted an impressive 2:53 26.2 PR — a feat accomplished (subsequent to our conversation) while balancing the tremendous rigors of her demanding career.I first came across Lindsay by way of her recurring cameos in my friend (and RRP guest from episodes 73, 144, & 174) Casey Neistat’s wildly popular vlog. So in 2015, I began following Lindsay’s career. As I watched her work mature and profile grow, I eagerly awaited each new article — and anticipated an opportunity to share her experience and insight on the podcast.Today is that day. And it’s everything I hoped it would be. We begin with Lindsay’s personal trajectory from Rhode Island roots and attending Harvard to landing a job at the most prestigious newspaper in the world.We discuss maternity rights and the gender wage gap by going behind the scenes on Nike’ relationship with pregnant athletes. The controversies surrounding Alberto Salazar and the Nike Oregon Project. The personal stories shared by Mary Cain, Kara Goucher, Alysia Montaño and Allyson Felix. And gymnast Katelyn Ohashi’s campaign to secure fair pay for NCAA athletes.We explore the ways in which the sports industry has failed to make way for women. Why almost all current sports science is based on men. And why conventional coaching has led to a sordid history of harming female athletes.In addition, Lindsay recounts what it’s actually like to work at The New York Times in our post-truth, ‘fake news’ world. The unique pressures that accompany breaking big stories. And how she manages to balance everything — and still kick serious ass in running.The ongoing impact of Lindsay’s journalism is immeasurable. So it was an absolute honor and a delight to sit down with her.Note: Because this conversation transpired at the New York Times offices (as opposed to my studio), we did not film the conversation. In addition, it was recorded in mid-October and thus not current with the immediate news cycle.I can’t say enough good things about Lindsay and the work she is doing to advance the role and voice of women in sports. I love this conversation. I sincerely hope you do as well.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

65,Lauren Fleshman,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/lauren-fleshman-493/,"Episode 493
January 20, 2020

“I changed my body for sport. No girl should.”Lauren FleshmanWhat is the current state of gender parity in sport? Ask today’s guest and she’ll tell you that women and girls are no longer content just to have a chance to play; they are demanding that sports be rebuilt altogether.Meet Lauren Fleshman.One of the greatest middle-distance runners in American history, Lauren has a storied history of breaking both records and paradigms. After collecting state championships as a standout high school runner, she matriculated to Stanford, where she garnered 5 NCAA titles, 15 All-American honors, and a spot in the Hall of Fame.As a professional, her accolades include two USA Championships and five World Championship berths for Team USA.Nonetheless, Lauren’s career was also marked with devastating setbacks. She holds the painful distinction of most likely being the best American distance runner never to make an Olympic team, her competitive career repeatedly impaired by injuries that had her on crutches at the wrong four-year intervals.It’s the hows and whys behind Lauren’s hard knocks that interest me the most. Because it’s these very misfortunes that underscore her philosophic perspective on running. Her take on human potential. Her belief in transformation. And, perhaps most poignant, her passion for advancing the power and prominence of women in sport.Now retired from professional competition, Lauren wears many hats. A prolific and talented writer, she is co-author of the Believe Training Journal series and shares her perspectives on her wildly popular Ask Lauren Fleshman blog — plus a book in the works.As an entrepreneur, Lauren hosts the Wilder Running & Writing Retreats. She’s the co-founder of performance nutrition company Picky Bars alongside her professional triathlete husband Jesse Thomas, who graced episode 442 of the podcast. And together they host the Work, Play, Love Podcast.In addition, Lauren serves up coaching duties to the elite women runners of Oiselle’s Littlewing Athletics. And she is the very definition of an active mom of two.Most compelling is Lauren’s committed, stalwart advocacy for female equality, empowerment and advancement in sport.Today we cover it all. From the doping scandals swirling around the Nike Oregon Project to revelations about the mental and physical health of female athletes under pressure, we explore how Lauren’s successes and failures fuel her as a coach, parent, businessperson and role model.But more than anything, this is about fairness in sport. Advancing the role of women in athletics to forge parity. Creating an equitable financial ecosystem for NCAA and Olympic athletes. And how we can better calibrate the complicated balance between human rights and equity with respect to transgender and intersex athletes.Perhaps most importantly, this is a conversation about the unique pressures and body image issues so many girls and women face in competitive sports. It’s about fostering healthier coaching dynamics. More supportive athletic environments — and ultimately more successful careers.In companionship with our exchange, I urge all of you to read Lauren’s moving New York Times OpEd, “I Changed My Body For My Sport. No Girl Should” — a powerful piece she penned subsequent to our conversation.Picky Bars Offer: As a simple thanks for listening, Lauren wanted to offer all of you a gift.

January 13, 2020

“Rather than using people as recipients of prescriptions, let’s instead work with people as partners to help them to put the best fuel in their bodies.”Neal Barnard, MDA predominant theme of this podcast is the profound impact of nutrition on long-term well-being.Less discussed is the importance of hormonal health. Most would be surprised to learn that certain maladies — including infertility, menstrual cramps, weight gain, hair loss, breast and prostate cancer, hot flashes, and many others — have one thing in common: they are fueled or influenced by hormones hiding in everyday foods.The good (and surprising) news is that proper nutrition can also help restore endocrine balance, often with benefits that rival popular medications.To provide insight on how hormones wreak havoc on the body, and how specific diet and lifestyle changes can help alleviate years of stress, pain and illness, I’m joined today by my friend Neal Barnard, MD.Making this third appearance on the podcast (check episodes #242 / #296), Dr. Barnard is a pre-eminent authority on diet, nutrition and its impact on illnesses such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer’s. In addition, he is the founder & president of The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), where he leads programs advocating for preventive medicine, good nutrition, and higher ethical standards in research.Dr. Barnard is also an adjunct associate professor of medicine at George Washington University and has authored over 70 scientific publications as well as 18 books, including Power Foods for the Brain, 21-Day Weight Loss Kickstart, Dr. Barnard’s Program for Reversing Diabetes and The Cheese Trap.Hitting bookstores February 4 and currently available for pre-order, Dr. Barnard’s latest offering — and the focus of today’s discussion — is entitled, Your Body in Balance: The New Science of Food, Hormones, and Health. A powerful step-by-step guide to better understand what you can do to feel better fast, it covers the important hows and whys of striking hormonal balance for optimal wellness.Today we dive deep to better understand the mechanisms of optimizing hormonal health.We begin with a deconstruction of recent science on the implications of eating meat on human health.We then turn to a wide-ranging discussion on the endocrine system. The impact of testosterone levels in men. And how diet and lifestyle impact fertility and menstruation in women.We examine how left unchecked, hormone imbalances can lead to everything from autoimmune diseases, hyperthyroidism, adrenal fatigue, depression and anxiety. And we conclude with the many simple things you can do to prevent such imbalances and thrive.You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I love this man. This is a fascinating discourse.

January 9, 2020

“Chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort.”Kelly McGonigal, PhDWe equate the new year with potential energy. It’s an opportunity to re-evaluate one’s trajectory. A permission grant to chart a new course of self-discovery.In truth, every moment presents a window for reinvention. But January always provides heightened urgency to inventory how we spend our precious time, focus our intention and deploy our energy.Extrapolating on themes explored with Chadd Wright, today we balance out the warrior alpha-male vibe with some feminine wisdom, courtesy of Kelly McGonigal, PhD.A health psychologist and lecturer at Stanford University who specializes in understanding the mind-body connection, Kelly is a pioneer in the field of ‘science-help,’ translating insights from psychology and neuroscience into practical strategies that support personal well-being and community connection.There’s a decent chance you caught her amazing 2013 TED Talk, How To Make Stress Your Friend. A viral hit with over 21 million views, Kelly makes the case that social connection is both a natural instinct and a source of resilience in times of stress.Or perhaps you’ve read one of her many amazing books, The Upside of Stress, The Willpower Instinct, or The Science of Compassion — all of which are based on classes Kelly has previously taught at StanfordThrough the Stanford Center for Compassion and Altruism, Kelly helped create Stanford Compassion Cultivation Training, a program now taught around the world that helps individuals strengthen their empathy, compassion, and self-compassion. And since 2000, she has taught dance, yoga, and group exercise in the San Francisco Bay Area.In addition, Kelly has served as the psychology consultant for The New York Times Education Initiative and has appeared broadly in many mainstream media outlets, including The Today Show, Good Morning America, The Anderson Cooper Show, and CNN.Fresh off the press and the framework for today’s conversation is her latest work, The Joy of Movement. A love letter to physicality (motivated in part by the dance, yoga, and group exercise classes she has been teaching for two decades), it’s an evidence-based primer on how movement can serve as an antidote to depression, anxiety, and loneliness — the modern epidemics of our time.Although we touch a bit on willpower and stress (the subjects explored in her previous books), this conversation focuses on what exactly happens when we move our bodies.But movement isn’t just about fitness. It’s not about the treadmill or StairMaster. And it has nothing to do with weight loss or six-pack abs.Instead, movement is about something far more important. It’s fundamental to being human. And a powerful path to that which we seek most — happiness, hope, connection, and courage.Drawing on neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology, today we discuss why movement need not be a chore, but rather a source of joy. A source of self-expression. A vehicle for cooperation and social connection. A tool for mastery. And for some, even an instrument for self-transcendence.Whether you’re an experienced ultramarathon runner, a CrossFit enthusiast or a couch potato with a new year’s resolution to finally get your heart rate up, Kelly is here to help deepen our collective understanding of how movement can create more meaning, pleasure, positivity and intimacy in our daily lives.You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Kelly is fantastic. And this conversation is a perfect way to embrace the new year enthusiastic about the body’s potential to quite literally change everything about how we experience ourselves and our communities.

68,Chadd Wright,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/chadd-wright-490/,"Episode 490
January 6, 2020

“You only have a certain amount of energy. Use it to promote the things you love.”Chadd WrightOur ‘Best Of’ anthology series isn’t the only annual tradition here at the RRP. Two years ago we started a new one, kicking off January with hard truths and bankable life advice designed to put that holiday excess in the rear view. Arrest the habits that don’t serve you. And calibrate the mind for challenges the new year will undoubtedly bring.In 2018 and 2019 our new year’s messenger was a former Navy SEAL turned motivational ultra-athlete they call the hardest man alive — David Goggins.Continuing on this theme, our first guest for 2020 is also a man who overcame unbelievable obstacles to become a Navy SEAL — and later an elite ultramarathoner.Meet Chadd Wright.Reared in the mountains of rural northwest Georgia, Chadd grew up obsessed with becoming a SEAL. But when the Navy discovered a rare but asymptomatic cyst on his heart, he was disqualified from entering BUDS. Undaunted, Chadd refused to give up, ultimately tracking down a surgeon willing to perform a procedure deemed too risky by every cardiologist he previously petitioned.Cyst successfully removed, Chadd went on to realize his SEAL dream, serving over the next decade as a Team Leader on multiple deployments to conflict zones across the world.He became a SEAL instructor. A Master Training Specialist. Chadd even served a stint as President Obama’s bodyguard. Along the way, he battled PTSD and traumatic brain injury. He faced his wife’s substance abuse issues. And he found God — a faith in part born from a paranormal experience he shares in riveting detail today.Now retired from the military, Chadd has found new life as an elite ultramarathoner — a spiritual quest for self-knowledge and mind-body mastery that has compelled him to tackle some of the world’s most insane endurance slogs like The Revenant — a 118-mile footrace across south New Zealand with over 52,000 feet of elevation gain that not one person has ever successfully completed.This conversation begins with Chad’s unique upbringing. His SEAL dream. And the heart condition that nearly derailed it.We discuss the day-to-day reality of the elite warrior. The supernatural experience and visions that embolden his faith. And the role Christianity plays in his spiritual equation.We talk about the perils of civilian re-entry. The allure of ultrarunning. His training regimen. The mental strategies deployed to venture beyond his limits. And a project he launched with his brother called 3-of-7.Chadd shares his perspective on the importance of breaking down big goals into bite size chunks. Why some people quit their dreams. Why others don’t. And what exactly separates the two.Finally, we talk about why the “stay hard’ mantra isn’t a sustainable life philosophy. The incredible power of spoken word. Disengaging from negativity. And the importance of channeling our limited energy into that which we love.Chadd’s mantra is simple:Never give pain a voice. And never, ever die in the chair.As a hardened warrior turned ultra-athlete, Chadd exudes a familiar energy I’d characterize as Goggins-adjacent. But Chadd is anything but a Goggins stand-in. He’s warmer. A bit more inviting. Perhaps it’s his personable, laconic southern drawl. Or maybe it’s his grounded faith in Christ. If Goggins and Josh LaJaunie had a son, his name just might be Chadd Wright.One thing is for certain — this guy is extremely authentic. Deeply soulful. And wise well beyond his 31 years.Packed with mindset tactics, powerful takeaways and inspiration for miles, Chadd’s tale of toil, perseverance and redemption will leave you riveted. Rethinking the ceiling on your own perceived limits. And prepared to tackle any dream you’ve set for the new year ahead.You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I fell in love with this man. And this conversation has stayed with me.

It’s been an incredible year. I’m deeply indebted to all my extraordinary guests. And unbelievably proud of the library we dedicated ourselves to creating over the last twelve months.To prepare for the year ahead, it’s critical to pause. To reflect back. Celebrate the victories. Take inventory of the missteps. And visualize the goals you wish to self-actualize in the months ahead. I believe in this process. And I feel strongly that 2020 holds the potential energy manifest your aspirations.It is in this spirit that we created a tradition of closing each year with a look in the rear view with a 2-episode compilation of clips excerpted from many of year’s best guests.Consider these next two shows as a love letter.

December 23, 2019

“You don’t have to be intersex to be able to relate to my story. Everyone is going through something they don’t feel like they can share. This story is for them as well.”Kendra LittleGrowing up in the late 1970’s there was no conversation around gender identity. You were either male or female. Period, end of discussion.Times have changed. The way we currently think about gender has evolved. Each day brings greater mainstream awareness to its non-binary nature — and the innate fluidity of gender roles and identity.Take a moment to imagine the experience of being intersex — a condition in which an individual is born with genetic variations on conventional sex characteristics.Now imagine trying to navigate the world from this non-binary biological disposition.This is the story of Kendra Little.Raised as a girl, at age 12 Kendra learned that she was born with something called androgen insensitivity syndrome, a variation of intersex that affects between 2 to 5 out of 100,000 people. The news prompted Kendra to isolate. Adopting a hormone protocol on the advice of her doctors, she remained a ‘girl’, proceeded to never discuss her condition with anybody and dove headlong into sports — a place where she excelled and felt at home.But eventually the emotional dissonance between her true self and that which she held out to the world became too much to bear, prompting her to walk away from a promising career as a professional golfer. But that disconnect ultimately catalyzed an amazing journey of self-discovery — and eventually wholeness.Now able to fully embrace her own unique identity (very recently I might add), Kendra is publicly sharing her story — with both courage and pride. The intention isn’t self-serving, but motivated by a genuine desire to change the way we think about non-binary gender constructs. To bring comfort to those ashamed of how they were born. And to openly permit sharing the many forms of loneliness, pain and shame so many of us keep hidden.This past July, Kendra tweeted me a video entitled Becoming More — her story in mini-doc form created by Uninterrupted, LeBron James’ production company.I click play. Instantly, I’m captivated by Kendra’s appearance. Her facial features present as simultaneously male and female. She’s both, but also neither. Kendra is truly her own unique form of humanity. But her appearance is quickly eclipsed by her strength and vulnerability — and the compelling narrative that unfolds.I knew immediately this was a special person I wanted to know better. A fascinating story I wanted to help tell. And quite honestly, a subject matter of social importance and cultural relevance I wanted to better understand.So here we are. Kendra, I honor you for your courage in trusting me with this conversation, a privilege I don’t take lightly.You can watch it all go down on YouTube (seeing Kendra helps contextualize the exchange). And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.This one is special. May it be as enjoyable and enlightening as it was for me.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

December 16, 2019

“My mission is to help 100 million people feel fantastic by restoring them to optimal health.”Rangan ChatterjeeToday we’re going to talk about stress.In proper doses it’s actually beneficial, promoting resilience — both physical and mental.But for most people, that dose isn’t proper. Instead it’s chronic — excessive, persistent and unrelenting. In fact, elevated levels of social and emotional stress have come to define our daily experience, leading the World Health Organization to qualify our chronic relationship with stress as “the health epidemic of the 21st Century”.Left untreated, it’s an incessant strain that promotes low libido, poor memory and weight gain. Ultimately it can lead to heart disease, depression, autoimmune disorders, premature aging and a litany of other serious and deleterious health conditions.This week’s guest has seen the perils of chronic stress first hand. A UK-based medical doctor, he found himself increasingly treating patients suffering from the downstream implications of living with this malevolence. It prompted him to ask, why is this happening?His name is Rangan Chatterjee, MD. He decided to find answers to this question — and do something about it.If that name sounds familiar, perhaps it’s because you caught him on the BBC, starring in Doctor in the House. Perhaps you read his bestselling book, The Four Pillar Plan, released in the United States under the title How To Make Disease Disappear. Or maybe, just maybe, you caught RRP 376, our popular first conversation from July of 2018 that launched our friendship.For those unfamiliar, Dr. Chatterjee is a pioneer in the field of progressive, functional medicine. Widely regarded as one of the most influential doctors in the UK, he is double board certified in internal medicine and family medicine and holds an honors degree in immunology. An in-demand lecturer, he created the very first “Prescribing Lifestyle Medicine” course accredited by the Royal College of General Practitioners in London.In addition, he hosts the popular Feel Better, Live More podcast (which I’ve appeared on twice) and has been widely featured on an array of prominent media outlets like the The New York Times, BBC, Forbes, The Guardian, The Financial Times, and many others.The focus of today’s conversation is also the subject of Rangan’s latest book, The Stress Solution — an important primer on how chronic stress can lead to disease, along with strategies, tools and lifestyle changes proven to protect against and reverse its toxic effects.This is a conversation about the very nature of stress. What creates it. The health implications it produces. The many simple things you can do to alleviate it — and it’s varied ill effects.More specifically, we discuss Rangan’s direct experience fielding patients with chronic stress — and the science-based strategies he deployed to ameliorate the condition and reverse it’s negative consequences.We talk about the critical role sleep, meditation and mindfulness practices play in combating stress. And how human touch, intimacy and connecting with nature can assuage it’s impact.We cover breathing techniques. Disconnecting from our devices. Carving out “me time”. The importance of finding passion — and infusing your life with purpose.Lastly, we dig into Rangan’s new found love for Swimrun (I’m taking a wee bit of credit for that one Dr. C!).You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I think we can all benefit from de-stressing ourselves this holiday season. Both fun and important, my hope is that you listen keenly — and put Dr. Chatterjee’s prescription into action.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

December 9, 2019

“Good and fast are not the same thing.”Scott FaubleFor the vast majority of us, besting our 26.2 personal record by 3+ minutes would be considered fine. Something to be celebrated, but hardly a mind-bending breakthrough.At the highest level of distance running however, the distinction is vast. It’s the canyon that separates a very good marathon runner from the greats.This is the story of Scott Fauble.Historically a very accomplished cross country & 10K runner (at the 2016 Olympic Trials he finished 4th in the 10,000 meters), Scott was unproven at the marathon. That is, until he ran 2:12 in Frankfurt in 2017 and matched that time the following year in New York.These performances certainly established Scott as a very good marathoner. But nobody, aside from Scott himself and perhaps his coach and close circle, was prepared for his stunning performance at the 2019 Boston Marathon. Not only did he surprise the world by leading the race for extended stretches, he accomplished what is almost unheard of at his level — besting his marathon PR by almost 3 and a half minutes to complete the course in 2:09:09 as the top American and 7th overall.It was a performance that foisted him into the mainstream spotlight. Anointed him as the leading American going into the 2020 Olympic men’s marathon. And established him as one of the world’s very best at the 26.2 discipline.Just as interesting are Faub’s pursuits when the running shoes come off. Alongside coach Ben Rosario he penned Inside a Marathon: An All-Access Pass to a Top-10 Finish at NYC. Documenting the entire four-month journey to Scott’s 7th place finish at the 2018 New York City Marathon, it’s a rare, candid (and very funny at times) behind-the-scenes look at the life of a professional marathoner. A chronicle of grit and mental fortitude, it’s a must read book for anyone committed to mastery.Unusual among top professional endurance athletes, yet simpatico with his fidelity to extreme transparency, Scott logs every training session on Strava (check out the file from Boston). He makes YouTube videos. A movie buff, he even hosts Showrunners — a podcast where he breaks down his all-time favorite films with fellow elite runners.This conversation runs the gamut. We begin with Scott’s young running career. Track his evolution to Boston. And his maturation into Olympic contender.We discuss life in Flagstaff, AZ. What he has learned under coach Ben Rosario and training alongside teammates on the HOKA Northern Arizona Elite Team.We talk about the coach-athlete relationship as partnership. We go deep into his breakthrough Boston performance. The strategies and techniques that produced that amazing result. And Scott’s mindset as he approaches Olympic Trials at the end of February.In addition, we explore his off-road pursuits. The intention behind writing a book. The why behind his podcast. And his deep love for burritos — all interests I can certainly relate to.In closing, we review the mistakes he sees many amateurs runners make — and how best to correct them.For Scott, it’s about process over results. Passion over podiums. And why ‘fast’ doesn’t always equate to ‘good’.You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Humble and jocular, Scott is a natural conversationalist — one of the good guys you just want to see win. So let’s put some wind in his sail for Olympic Trials.I really enjoyed this one and sincerely hope you do as well.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Love is not something found in a person, place or thing. It’s something that is ever present in our hearts and always available as a gift and it costs nothing to share it.”Ryland EngelhartLast week we explored the world of regenerative farming, soil health and biodiversity as critical levers to improve human health. Consolidate food security. Drawdown carbon. And backpedal climate change.Today we expound on that theme with entrepreneur, restauranteur and social activist Ryland Engelhart.Ryland is the ‘Mission Fulfillment Officer’ and co-owner of Café Gratitude and Gracias Madre, a family owned group of legendary plant-based restaurants. The epicenter of California vegan cuisine & culture, it’s a platform he uses to not only feed people amazing food but to cultivate community — and most importantly, inspire more gratitude into our lives and culture.In addition, Ryland is a speaker and passionate advocate for sacred commerce, community building and regenerative farming principles, which he supports as co-founder of Kiss The Ground, a non-profit that provides education regarding the connection between soil, human, and planetary health. Among its board of advisors are former podcast guests Paul Hawken, Dr. Zach Bush and David Bronner.If you enjoyed those conversations, or last week’s exchange with John & Molly Chester, then you’re in for a treat with Ryland.This is a conversation about the importance of soil regeneration and its impact on everything from food security and climate change reversal to improving human health.We open with Ryland’s hippie upbringing. How he learned early the philosophy of using business as a force for good — something he calls sacred commerce.We discuss how doing good — adding value to people’s lives — is not only always the right thing to do, but also the best long-term path to profits.We explore the origins, trajectory and intentionality behind his family’s incredible group of restaurants — Cafe Gratitude, Gracias Madre and his sister’s Sage Plant-Based Bistros — which together form the cornerstone of plant-based dining in Los Angeles and beyond.Then we dive into the principles of conscious capitalism, the importance of regenerative farming, and the reasons why soil health is such a crucial component in the holistic equation of sustainable human, animal and planetary health.Finally we discuss his various film projects, including his documentaries May I Be Frank* and Kiss The Ground — a must see you might have heard Woody Harrelson recently raving about on Marc Maron’s podcast.But more than anything, this is a conversation about love, awareness, and the power of gratitude as a living, breathing philosophy of life.You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.A good friend, it was a pleasure to dive deep with Ryland.

76,John & Molly Chester,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/biggest-little-farm-482/,"Episode 482
November 25, 2019

“This all started with a promise that we would leave the big city and build a life in perfect harmony with nature.”John ChesterBiodiversity. Regenerative agriculture. Ecological sustainability. Carbon drawdown. Climate change reversal.These are popular themes that recur regularly on this show. But in practical terms, what do they actually mean?I wanted to better understand these subjects. Not from the perspective of an academic, scientific researcher or political pundit but rather from the direct experience of actual practitioners — people who live and practice it every single day — farmers.Nine years ago, personal chef Molly Chester and her filmmaker husband John Chester traded their life in urban Santa Monica for 200 acres of infertile land nestled in the foothills of Ventura County — an arid and desolate plot called Apricot Lane Farms.Hence began a journey to build a new life from scratch. The vision? An organic, biodiverse farm based upon regenerative principles, thriving in harmony with nature. It began with repairing the draught-laden, nutrient deplete soil, followed by planting 10,000 orchard trees. Rooting over 200 crops. Introducing a myriad of animals. Managing the chaos that ensued. And patiently stewarding the farm from inert to irascible and ultimately into what it is today — an awe-inspiring symphonic ecosystem in vibrant, sustainable co-existence with nature’s rhythms.Along the way, John chronicled every daunting, obstacle-fraught step, plying his storytelling skills and masterful wildlife cinematography to produce The Biggest Little Farm — an extraordinary documentary that evidences the planet’s innate power to heal itself in synchronous partnership with humans devoted to restoring its precious biodiversity. Uplifting and wildly entertaining, it dispenses with the dystopia common among ecological fare, instead leaving audiences uplifted — and in love with the hard-earned possibility of positive change.I was quite moved by this film. Compelled to know more, me and my team spent a day touring Apricot Lane — an educational and eye-opening experience that left me with a deep appreciation for the Chester’s achievement — and the nuanced complexity of their mission.In the wake of my visit to Apricot Lane, I posted images from the experience on Instagram, accompanied by an expression of gratitude and respect for manifesting what environmentalists unanimously urge mandatory to repair the rapidly vanishing biodiversity of our precious soil (literally the planet’s microbiome). To sequester carbon and create sustainable food security. And to serve as a viable model for the future of farming.John and Molly didn’t just protest climate change. They got to work, taking an action-based stand against the glyphosate-laden, chemical-based industrial, conglomerate owned, seed-controlled, GMO-infused, animal intensive CAFO factory farms that monopolize our current food system to the great demise of human, animal and ecological health.More than anything, Apricot Lane proves that regenerative farming isn’t just possible, but profitable. And that it doesn’t just work, but exceeds conventional methods by yield volume and nutritional density metrics. Meanwhile, it controverts planetary warming by drawing down carbon and building long-term, natural resilience against pestilence, drought and soil erosion without the products and practices ‘BigAg’ wants you to believe are mandatory.Basically, John and Molly live the credo echoed by several past podcast favorites and their respective advocacy organizations. People like Zach Bush, MD (Farmer’s Footprint), Paul Hawken (Project Drawdown), David Bronner (Climate Collaborative), and next week’s guest Ryland Engelhart (Kiss The Ground). All vegans, these influential leaders in the sustainability space unanimously urge the adoption of regenerative farming practices as mission critical to solving climate change and restoring planetary biodiversity.Back to my Instagram post. Although overall well received, it was also met with a loud and angry response by certain members of the vegan community. Albeit a predominantly agricultural farm, many animals call Apricot Lane home, where they also serve a key role in the soil regeneration process. Because a small number of these animals are later sold for food, this contingent of the vegan community interpreted my visit as an indefensible betrayal. Calls to ‘cancel’ me soon followed.To those who expressed such disappointment, I get it and I hear you. I appreciate your perspective and I respect your passion. As someone who considers himself a compassionate vegan, I don’t like the idea that any animal is slaughtered, irrespective of how ‘humanely’ a life is ended or how much it was loved and cared for during its life. I made the choice to not participate in this cycle over 12 years ago. As such, I am by no means endorsing this practice. I would like to think that if I was in the Chester’s shoes, I wouldn’t make that choice.But here’s the thing. I’m not them. I’m not a farmer. And although I am of course aware that there are veganic farms, I can’t truthfully appreciate the difficult and nuanced realities of actually running a farm.What I do know is that as much as we would like to believe that these issues are binary, they are not. Nothing is truly black and white. And if your perspective is so hardened that you cannot (or worse, downright refuse) to learn from someone whose experience-based perspective differs from that of your own, then we stand little hope of moving forward as a society.I refuse to stand in judgment of these people. In fact I have great empathy for John and Molly. They are not keyboard warriors ranting on principle without action, or criticizing without doing, but instead people on the front lines, acting on the solution of climate change reversal every day.Truth must prevail over dogma. And the uncomfortable truth is that none of us are exempt from creating harm. Even those that subsist on organic produce alone must face the reality that the harvesting of plants inevitably and quite directly results in countless animal deaths — especially when conventionally grown.Moreover, if you’re procuring your produce from a typical modern farm, you’re not only participating in that cycle of animal harm but also contributing to the ills of chemical-based monocropping, including soil depletion, water table pollution and a litany of other environmental harms that have downstream effects on animal welfare.My point is rather simple. None of us are holier than thou. We can all do better and be better. I certainly can. But to do that we must be open to learning from those more experienced in these issues. And we must cultivate more empathy and respect for people who may not align perfectly with your binary perspective yet offer something valuable, maybe even critical, for us to hear and learn from.A central tenet of veganism is compassion. Not just for the animals but for each other. So let’s all try to practice that a bit better. Because what the world needs now more than ever is empathy, surely for the animals, but also for each other. You can watch the conversation on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Final Note: On November 11 (after recording the podcast and my introduction), Biggest Little Farm took home a Critics Choice Documentary award for best cinematography. Congrats to John, Molly & the entire film crew!I love this conversation.

“Be aware of the ignorance without judging the ignorance.”Guru SinghMaking his 9th appearance on the podcast, today marks another mind-bending deep dive into the multiverse with Guru Singh, my treasured friend and favorite wizard of all things mystical.For those newer to the show, imagine a modern-day Gandalf who rocks like Hendrix while dropping pearls of wisdom that beautifully fuse Eastern mysticism with Western pragmatism.A celebrated third-generation Sikh yogi, master spiritual teacher, author, and family man, for the past 40 years Guru Singh has been studying and teaching Kundalini Yoga. He is the author of several books, a powerful lecturer, and behind-the-scenes guide to many a luminary, including Fortune 500 CEOs, athletes, and artists.Guru Singh is also a talented musician who rocked alongside Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead in the 1960s. When he isn’t recording tracks with people like Seal, he’s bringing down the house on the daily at Yoga West, his Los Angeles home base.The focus of today’s discourse? Awareness.We talk about the importance of self care, crucial as we near the pressures that accompany the holiday season.We discuss cancel culture. The critical distinction between awareness and judgment. And empathy versus endorsement.And we dive into the incredible power of awareness to cultivate an objectivity about ourselves, others and the world we inhabit.As always, Guru Singh takes us out with a song, so make sure to stick around to the end.You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Enjoy!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

November 18, 2019

“Just because something is hard in the beginning doesn’t mean it’s always going to be.”Robbie BalengerImagine running an ultramarathon. It’s a huge undertaking for anyone. And a bucket list dream for many.Now imagine running an ultramarathon every day. A minimum of 40 miles, 75 days in a row. Starting in Los Angeles. Finishing in New York. A 3,200 mile transcontinental run.This is the story of Robbie Balenger.Just 6 years ago, Robbie laced up his first pair of running shoes to alleviate the stress he was experiencing managing a restaurant. A small act, that first run set in motion a chain of events that led to a passion for running long distances, followed by a purpose-driven mission promote a message — the power of a plant-based diet to fuel athletic performance. Prevent and reverse certain lifestyle maladies. Ameliorate suffering. And redress climate change.What Robbie didn’t expect? The many extraordinary ways running creates community. Unites people across the economic divide. And bridges the political differences that drive us apart.I was unfamiliar with Robbie until an e-mail hit my inbox courtesy of my friend and former podcast guest, Olympic cyclist Dotsie Bausch (RRP 355). Her non-profit Switch4Good was sponsoring Robbie’s attempt to cross the United States by foot. Would I be interested in helping to support their efforts? I jumped at the opportunity.On March 16, I showed up at dawn in Huntington Beach to meet Robbie for the first time and help kick off his momentous attempt.Running the first several miles alongside Robbie and a small crew of supporters, I immediately took to his earnest yet humble disposition. His passion for promoting the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle. And his determination to reach New York a mere 75 days later.We struck up a friendship that day. I kept keen tabs on his progress over the following months. And made him a promise:Finish the run and you earn a seat at the podcast table.All heart, he indeed finished it. Today I honor that promise. And it’s a great story, well told.You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange as much as I relished having it.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

November 11, 2019

“I think ego is the deepest addiction there is.”Edward NortonOne of the most acclaimed actors of his generation, today Edward Norton graces the podcast to discuss his fascinating life and perspective on filmmaking, culture, politics and the nature of power.Over the course of his extraordinary career, Edward has reaped 3 Academy Award nominations starring in some of the greatest films of our era — Primal Fear, American History X, Fight Club, Birdman, and 25th Hour among them.The occasion for this conversation is Motherless Brooklyn — a long-gestating passion project Edward wrote, directed, produced and headlines. A period crime noir that confronts the shadowy malevolence of power in 1950’s New York City, Edward stars as a twitchy tourettic detective determined to find his boss’ killer. Evocative of Chinatown, it’s a towering achievement and terrific watch I implore all of you to immediately see in the theatre.Unfamiliar to most are Edward’s many off-screen interests and achievements as an entrepreneur, investor, philanthropist and environmentalist.In 2010, he co-founded CrowdRise, a crowdfunding platform which has raised over $500M for non-profits which later sold to GoFundMe. He is the co-founder of an advanced data science company called EDO which provides audience analytics to media companies. In addition, Edward is an avid pilot and founding board president of the Masai Wilderness Conservation Trust, a Kenyan conservation and community development organization. To raise awareness for the organization, in 2009 he ran the New York Marathon alongside a group of Masai, completing the race in 3:28.And that’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this hyper-intelligent polymath.A famously private person, Edward has been uncharacteristically public as of late — making the mainstream media and podcast rounds to promote Motherless Brooklyn.If you caught his appearance on Marc Maron, Ezra Klein, Preet Bharara, Joe Rogan, Dax Shepard or Alec Baldwin’s respective podcasts (all great in their own right) — this conversation is a bit different.Today we dive into the role of ego in his profession. We dissect disenfranchisement and the implications of weaponized social media in our politically divided culture. And we talk about the state of environmental activism.On the subject of creativity, we explore the importance of gestation — distancing yourself from the noise to reboot artistic originality. We discuss balancing art against other life priorities. And how his deep interest in the nature of power underscores his latest work.Motherless Brooklyn is now playing in theaters nationwide. If you enjoy this conversation, desire to support Edward — and dig smart, mature, entertaining cinema — please make a priority of seeing this movie in the cinema pronto.They say never meet your heroes. I disagree. A pinch me moment, it was an absolute pleasure and honor to talk with a man I respect and admire tremendously.You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Run when you can, walk if you have to, crawl if you must; just never give up.”Dean KarnazesGracing us with his beautiful presence for a third appearance on the show, my guest today is none other than the legendary ultra-marathon man himself.For those who missed RRP 115 and/or RRP 259, Dean Karnazes is an internationally recognized endurance athlete, New York Times bestselling author, and philanthropist globally lauded for his preternatural ability to push his body and mind to limits inconceivable to mere mortals.Among his many palmerès, Dean has:In addition to his many feats of mind-bending athletic prowess,  Dean’s first book, Ultramarathon Man not only personally inspired my path, it put the previously sequestered subculture of ultrarunning on the map, laying the foundation for the sport’s explosion in popularity over the last decade.In recognition of Dean’s accomplishments, Time magazine named Dean one of the “Top 100 Most Influential People in the World.” Men’s Fitness hailed him as one of the fittest men on the planet. And Dean has been profiled in virtually every major publication, including features on 60 Minutes, The David Letterman Show, CBS News, CNN, BBC, ESPN, The Howard Stern Show, NPR’s Morning Edition, and many others.Most importantly, Dean is an overall stellar human, leveraging his copious talents for good.Picking up where we left off three years ago, this conversation focuses on Dean’s latest book, Running for Good: 101 Stories for Runners & Walkers to Get You Moving. An inspirational collection of personal anecdotes, it chronicles the physical and mental health benefits of hitting the road or the trail. More importantly, these stories demonstrate the power of running to catalyze a better world for all.In addition, we discuss how his Greek heritage informs his running. His experience running the Silk Road. How he perceives his role in the global growth of ultrarunning. The power of embracing discomfort. And many other topics of interest.A dear friend and mentor, I’m delighted to once again share Dean’s grace, wisdom and experience with you today.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Music is mystical. At the beginning, you don’t even know why. You just feel. Then you hit a point when you forget that feeling and you have to meet it again.“Rodrigo SánchezIt’s one thing to be an artist. But to become a successful creative — revered for your art — is quite another thing altogether.Even more rare are the few who deftly navigate the vicissitudes of an acclaimed artistic career (or any career for that matter), with a highly conscious, devotional approach.Musicians Rodrigo Sánchez and Gabriela Quintero — popularly known as the Mexican acoustic rock guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela — are not only incredible masters of their craft, they fully embody this ethos. It’s a sensibility that has carried them from obscurity in Mexico. To busking on Grafton Street in Dublin. And ultimately to playing premier sold out venues all across the globe.Along the way, Rod & Gab have performed at the White House for the Obamas. They’ve collaborated on film scores with world renowned composers like Hans Zimmer. And lent their talents to television shows like Breaking Bad — all while staying true to themselves and their utterly unique Metallica meets Flamenco artistic sensibility.For those unfamiliar with this dynamic duo, prepare to be amazed.I had the good fortune to witness them perform live at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles the night before this conversation. Unlike anything I had previously seen or heard, it was a transcendent experience that defies attempts to adequately describe.Fortunately, I don’t have to. Today, in addition to the quality conversations you’ve come to expect with this show, we expand the format to weave a mini-concert into the experience — a rare treat certain to delight.Beyond the acoustic wall of sound, this is a conversation about a creative spark that began with heavy metal roots in Mexico City. It’s about how busking on the streets of Dublin led to a huge break. And the extraordinary career that followed.We discuss the influences and evolution of Rod and Gab’s unique style. The importance of mastery in their musicianship and personal lives. And we explore the role meditation, spirituality and veganism has played in their self and career development.Gab and Rod call it Mettavolution.Intercut with live performance, along the way they share amazing stories. What it was like playing Letterman. Performing for the Obamas. And working on big Hollywood films like Pirates of the Caribbean.Lastly, this is an episode you’re going to want to watch on YouTube. It’s one thing to hear Rod & Gab perform. But it’s another thing altogether to observe their mastery in motion. To bear witness, visit bit.ly/rodrigoygabriela477I’m in love with these two.

82,Mark Manson,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/mark-manson-476/,"Episode 476
October 28, 2019

“Constant stimulation complicates our understanding of ourselves. The more options we have, the less willing we are to compromise what we want to be with somebody else.”Mark MansonOne day not long ago, I awoke to a bright orange book ubiquitously displayed everywhere I looked.Provocatively titled The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, today’s guest birthed a publishing sensation, custom tailored for click-bait embrace.The title also made the book easy to dismiss. In fact, freely admit to downright refusing to read it. But it just would not go away. Not only did it top the New York Times bestseller list, the book stayed there. 6 million plus copies later, it still rests at #4 — a full 149 weeks since its publication.So who is this Mark Manson guy?Realizing that my reflexive reaction was perhaps misplaced, I finally relented. And was pleasantly surprised by what I discovered.To be sure, the book is both contrarian and confrontational. Chock-a-block with f-bombs. But it’s also surprisingly refreshing, upending the tired tropes of self-help with an intractable glee. Grappling with real issues, I relished Mark’s unique voice — depth meets grit with an infectious philosophical sensibility.Before he became a publishing juggernaut (his influence launching countless profanely titled copycat books), Mark began his writing career as a blogger. Sharing personal development advice that ‘doesn’t suck’ (his words), he has amassed a devoted audience of 2 million monthly readers.Dissecting our dysfunctional cultural relationship with money, entertainment and the internet, Mark’s latest chart-topper, Everything Is F*cked: A Book About Hope is an equally compelling yet more mature follow up that deftly explores the perils of distraction, comfort and success.This is a conversation about what happens when you exceed your every ambition. What then?Today we explore the high-altitude, existential crisis visited upon a young man who eclipsed his wildest dreams by age 32.More specifically, we cover Mark’s backstory as a blogger. We dissect the method to his various forms of madness. We discuss the enormous unexpected success of his first book. And the pressures that accompanied his skyward trajectory.Ultimately, this is a dialog about our increasingly distracted world. It’s about the soul erosion precipitated by too much comfort. And it’s a sounding call to restore the foundation of human dignity.You can watch it all go down on YouTube and as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I really enjoyed my time with Mark — and left this conversation with great respect for his profoundly curious mind and finely honed insights on the human condition.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

83,Amelia Boone,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/amelia-boone-475/,"Episode 475
October 24, 2019

“I don’t want to be ‘the eating disorder recovery girl’, I don’t want to be ‘the athlete’. This is just me. I’m super flawed, I’m super complex, just like everybody else out there.”Amelia BooneToday’s guest is lauded for her grit. And a preternatural ability to suffer.Her name is Amelia Boone. And she is the most dominant & decorated female in the history of OCR (obstacle course racing).Over the course of her storied athletic career, Amelia has amassed over 50 podiums and 30 victories. She is a Spartan Race World Champion and 3-time World’s Toughest Mudder Champion. The ultimate weekend warrior, she’s done all of this while balancing a full time career as a corporate attorney — first at the prestigious Skadden Arps law firm in Chicago and currently at Apple in Silicon Valley.Dubbed ‘The Queen of Pain’, it’s a career that’s landed her magazine covers, major publication features, national television gigs, and a legion of adoring fans across the world.But it’s also a career that came with pressures that drained the fun out of competition. And a mask that obscured a deeper dysfunction lurking beneath the surface.Amidst the celebration of Amelia as an unbreakable champion, prodded for her daily habits, morning routine and training regimen, she privately battled an obstacle more daunting than any race she’d endured: an eating disorder she kept hidden for the better part of two decades.Today we celebrate Amelia not for her accolades, but for a different kind of courage — the vulnerability to face her disorder. Forge a path to wholeness. And change the way we talk about about a condition that debilitates millions.I first met Amelia a couple years ago. I freely admit my projection of her steely disposition intimidated me. But slowly she began sharing more openly and about her struggles, culminating in a vulnerable blog post that laid bare her protracted struggle. Her guilt. Her shame. Her honesty. Her courage.The facade gone, I fell for the human. I wanted to help amplify her powerful message. Today I have that honor.This is a conversation about the perniciousness and pervasiveness of eating disorders. And the path towards healing.More specifically, we discuss the difference between an eating disorder and disordered eating. The distinction between anorexia and bulemia. And how Amelia’s particular strain of this condition, known as ‘relative energy deficiency in sport’ (red-s), led to the many bone injuries that sidelined her athletic trajectory skyward.We dive into the relationship between childhood trauma and eating disorders. The psychological consequences of starving one’s self. The ‘shame spiral’ that perpetuates the condition. The denial she compartmentalized with Pop-Tarts. The clarity and courage required to seek treatment. What is required to build a strong foundation for long-term recovery. And advice for those who currently suffer.A companion piece to my conversation with Dotsie Bausch (RRP 355), my hope is that this conversation — a must listen for anyone caught in the grips of this disorder — provides the necessary nuance and clarity to better understand an affliction that impacts over 30 million people in the US alone.You can watch it all go down on YouTube and as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.If you are struggling with an eating disorder and are in need of support, please call the National Eating Disorders Association Helpline at 1-800-931-2237. For a 24-hour crisis line, text “NEDA” to 741741.Final Note: This was recorded in late July. First, thank you for your patience. I know this episode is anticipated by many. And second, I’m happy to report that Amelia is back competing. Congrats Amelia for running 112 miles at last weekend’s Big’s Backyard Ultra!I appreciate Amelia entrusting me with helping tell her story. It’s an honor and privilege I don’t take lightly.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

October 20, 2019

“The mission of Impossible Foods is very simple. It’s to completely replace animals in the food system by 2035.”Pat BrownBy now, most of you have heard about the Impossible Burger.I imagine many of you have tried it.  Arguably the ‘beefiest’ plant-based patty, even the most attuned palate has trouble believing it isn’t real meat. Now ubiquitous at fine dining establishments and fast food franchises alike, it’s a global phenomenon.Today we explore the mission behind the burger with Impossible Foods founder & CEO Pat Brown, the man responsible for upending everything you thought you knew about plant-based meat, on a mission to forge a better environmental future for all.A world-renowned geneticist, Pat is a former Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and Professor of Biochemistry at Stanford University. He is also a founder of Lyrical Foods, maker of Kite Hill artisanal nut milk-based cheeses and a founder of the Public Library of Science (PLOS), a nonprofit publisher that pioneered the open-access business model. Pat was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2002, and is a member of the Institute of Medicine. His numerous accolades include the American Cancer Society Medal of Honor, and the NAS Award in Molecular Biology.Moved to action by the urgent need to redress global climate change, Pat founded Impossible Foods with one clear goal: to eliminate animal agriculture — inarguably one of the biggest contributors to planetary warming — by providing delicious, nutritious, and environmentally friendly alternatives to meat and dairy directly from plants.The mission statement is ambitious, some would even say audacious. But his impact is already undeniable — and he’s just getting started.Today he shares his story.This is a broad and far-reaching conversation that covers Pat’s background and the impetus behind Impossible Foods.We cover the company’s initial success in converting high-end chefs, the subsequent penetration of the fast food industrial complex, and the entrepreneurial difficulties of rapid growth and meeting demand at scale.We then turn attention to Pat’s mission to redress climate change. The important need to replace food from livestock with more environmental friendly alternatives. And what is required to achieve that, while meeting the finicky palate requirements of the average consumer.Irrespective of your opinion on plant-based meat analogues, the deleterious environmental impact of intensive animal agriculture is irrefutable. Seismic changes to our food systems are mandatory if we want to responsibly redress global climate change. And each of us has the power to promote these changes, beginning with our daily food choices.You can watch it all go down on YouTube and as always, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I really enjoyed this exchange. A compelling companion piece to last week’s conversation with Paul Hawken, my sit down with Beyond Meat founder and CEO Ethan Brown and my episodes with Good Food Institute founder Bruce Friedrich (RRP 286 & 402), I encourage all of you to listen with an open and appreciative mind.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

October 13, 2019

“There’s no difference between a climate denier and somebody who’s literate in climate change and doesn’t do anything.”Paul HawkenI’m ecstatic to share my first live podcast event, recorded at the Los Angeles Wilshire Ebell Theatre on September 27, 2019.For all of us, this podcast is an abstraction. The motivation behind the event was to create a tactile, analog experience for 1,100 people to gather around shared purpose and passion. An opportunity to cultivate community. Raise consciousness. Elevate intimacy. Deepen personal connectivity around our collective humanity — and the important ideas of our time.An unforgettable lifetime moment, the resulting impact exceeded my wildest expectations. I’m still basing in the glow. And deeply grateful for an experience that left me feeling more intimately connected with all of you — and optimistic about the future of our planet.The program opens with the poetic spoken word genius of my friend and two-time podcast guest IN-Q (check out RRP 81 & RRP 118).Named to Oprah Winfrey’s SuperSoul 100 list of the world’s most influential thought leaders, IN-Q is a National Poetry Slam Champion, multi-platinum songwriter, and world-renowned keynote speaker. His groundbreaking performances include selling out one of the largest one-man poetry shows in US history, being the first spoken word artist to perform with Cirque Du Soleil, and being featured on HBO’s Def Poetry Jam and A&E’s Look Closer campaign, which debuted during the Emmys. He has been featured in major media ranging from Forbes to AdWeek and several of his recent videos have gone viral with over 60 million combined views.I then take the stage to share some thoughts, including a powerful listener e-mail, before settling into a fascinating conversation with Paul Hawken — one of the world’s pre-eminent authorities on global climate change and a man who has indelibly shaped my personal perspective on ecological responsibility.A pioneering environmentalist, activist, entrepreneur, architect of corporate reform, and multiple New York Times bestselling author, Paul has dedicated his life to environmental sustainability and changing the relationship between business and the environment. His work includes founding successful ecologically conscious businesses (including the natural foods market Erewhon), writing about the impacts of commerce on living systems and consulting with heads of state and CEOs on economic development, industrial ecology and environmental policy. In addition to penning countless op-eds and peer reviewed articles, Paul has written 8 books, including Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming. Paul is also the Founder and Founding Executive Director of Project Drawdown, an extraordinary non-profit dedicated to researching and implementing solutions for reversing global warmingPaul has lectured everywhere, including Harvard, Stanford and Wharton. He has given commencement addresses at Yale and Berkeley. He has appeared on Bill Maher, Charlie Rose, Larry King and countless other media outlets. And his new book, Regeneration: Ending The Climate Crisis In One Generation, hits bookstores in 2020.This is about poetry, recovery, and personal growth.It’s about environmental activism. Hope. And the personal responsibility we share to live in the solution to the immense problems our world currently faces.But most of all, it’s about community. Connection. And the power of the collective to unite around the important ideas of our time — so together we can drive a better future for all.Note: We professionally filmed the entire experience, so if you typically digest the show in audio-only format, I highly suggest watching this episode on YouTube — the production value is off the hook gorgeous, significantly elevating the experience beyond the earbuds. Nonetheless, the audio version streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Both Paul and IN-Q are among my very favorite people. Combined they are even more extraordinary. It was a true honor and privilege to host this experience. I sincerely hope you enjoy it as much as I and the live audience did.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

October 9, 2019

“Creativity is a muscle. It’s a habit not a skill. It’s a process not a product.”Chase JarvisConventional wisdom frames creativity as the purview of a certain select few — a rare gift that eludes us mere mortals.This is a lie. We are all born creative. More birthright than blessing, creativity is a practice. A habit not unlike any other skill or discipline. A muscle that can be built and flexed.This week’s guest takes the notion one step further, asserting creativity as a biological necessity — a transformative force that resides within us all that when unleashed delivers vitality to everything we do.Chase Jarvis is many things. One of the most influential and award-winning photographers of the last decade, he is the recipient of numerous awards and accolades. Dubbed by Forbes as ‘the photographer everyone wants to work with’, Chase has created hundreds of campaigns and commercials for the likes of Nike, Apple, Samsung, Google, and Red Bull.As a photojournalist, Chase contributed to the Pulitzer-Prize winning New York Times story Snow Fall and earned an Emmy nomination for Portrait of a City, his documentary chronicling the legendary Seattle music scene.As an entrepreneur, Chase is the Founder and CEO of two influential companies. His iPhone app Best Camera earned ‘App of the Year’ accolades in 2009 from Wired, the New York Times, and Macworld. The first app that allowed users to share images direct to social networks, it is widely credited with kicking off the multi-billion dollar, global photo-sharing craze. CreativeLive, Chase’s second (and current) company, is the world’s largest live-streaming education company featuring the top experts in photography, design, music and entrepreneurship.In addition to being an in demand public speaker, Chase hosts the wildly popular YouTube series and podcast The Chase Jarvis LIVE Show and has authored 2 best-selling photography books.The focus of today’s exchange is Chase’s latest literary offering, Creative Calling. A fantastic primer on the power of developing your innate creativity to infuse your life with greater meaning, purpose and fulfillment, I can’t recommend it more highly — a book that earns it’s place alongside my personal favorite practice guides, The Artist’s Way and The War of Art.A long-time fan, I have been an avid consumer of Chase’s high quality content dating back to the early days of the internet. A kindred spirit of sorts, I had always wanted to meet him. Today’s encounter exceeds my expectations.In addition to recounting Chase’s fascinating personal story, this is an important and compelling conversation about the very nature of creativity — and how it can be leveraged to live more intentional lives.Demystifying the force that resides within us all, we dive deep into why creativity is an essential aspect of being human. We cover practical tools for developing and unleashing that which is both universal and personal. And we discuss why establishing a creative practice is our most valuable and urgent task, as important to our well-being as exercise or nutrition.You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I think its fair to say we make a bit of magic today.

87,Dr. Jud Brewer,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/jud-brewer-471/,"Episode 471
October 6, 2019

“What we’re seeing with meditation is that when we get out of our own way, our brains naturally work better and we can really start to get into the flow of things and in sync with life.”Dr. Jud BrewerAddiction is tenacious. We’re all craven animals, vulnerable to habits that don’t serve us. Whether it’s constantly checking social media, binge eating, smoking, compulsive shopping or excessive drinking, most of us fall prey to compulsions we feel powerless to arrest.Why is this? And what can neuroscience teach us about the nature of cravings and how to overcome them?Dr. Jud Brewer has devoted his career to answering these questions. His discoveries just might change your life.A psychiatrist, neuroscientist, thought leader and scientific researcher in the field of habit change and the “science of self-mastery”, Dr. Brewer is the founder of MindSciences and Director of Research and Innovation at the Brown University Mindfulness Center. Formerly, he served as an associate professor in Medicine and Psychiatry at UMass Medical School, an adjunct faculty member at Yale University, and a research affiliate at MIT.Dr. Brewer has published numerous peer-reviewed articles and book chapters. He has trained U.S.A. Olympic coaches. His work has been featured on 60 Minutes, Time magazine, Forbes, BBC, NPR, Businessweek and many other prominent media outlets. And his TED Talk, A Simple Way To Break A Bad Habit, is the 4th most viewed TED talk of 2016 with over 13 million views to date.As a long-time recovering alcoholic prone to a myriad of compulsive behaviors, it’s fair to say that habit change is an obsession. Always on the hunt to extend my sobriety routine beyond 12-step, I came across Dr. Brewer’s book, The Craving Mind. A scientific primer on the mechanisms of habit and addiction formation, it makes the case for how mindfulness can help us transcend cravings, reduce stress, and ultimately live a fuller life.I was compelled by Dr. Brewer’s findings. I needed to know more. And so here we are.This is a powerful and potentially life altering conversation about the psychiatric and neurological nature of addiction. It’s a deep dive into the science of habit change. And it’s a master class on how meditation and mindfulness can help us finally overcome the unhealthy patterns that live between our reality and the best version of ourselves lurking within.Note: As a special thanks for listening, Dr. Brewer was gracious enough to offer my listeners a special discount on his evidence based habit change programs specifically designed to overcome anxiety and cravings. Visit drjud/richroll and enter code RICHROLL2019 and you will receive 20% off a subscription to any of his three apps for Android or iPhone (Unwinding Anxiety, Eat Right Now and Craving to Quit). As a disclaimer, I am not an affiliate and have no financial interest or otherwise with these programs – just sharing the good doctor’s kind offer.The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.A companion piece to my recent podcast with Atomic Habits author James Clear, my hope is that this solution-based exchange assists you in overcoming the compulsions that don’t serve youOn a personal level, I learned a ton — and have already experienced positive results.

September 29, 2019

“There’s no one magical thing you do and then have stillness. It’s a process.”Ryan HolidayHe’s best known for popularizing Stoicism — an ancient philosophical yet highly practical operating system he pioneered to mainstream, modern adoption.In his latest turn, Ryan Holiday expands his lens East.In pursuit of shared wisdom across ancient Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu, Hebrew, Greek, Christian and Epicurean traditions, he discovered one essential truth — that inner peace is essential to a life of purpose, meaning and fulfillment.Ryan calls it stillness — to be steady while the world spins around you. A crucial characteristic of all great leaders, thinkers, artists, athletes and visionaries, it’s a practice to transcend the stress of everyday life. An antidote to the distractions of our fast-paced world. And the ultimate path to meaning, contentment, and excellence in a world that needs more of it than ever.For those unfamiliar, Ryan is an autodidact who dropped out of college at 19, maturing into one of the most important thinkers of his generation. Now 32, he is a media strategist, prolific writer and public speaker with six perennial bestselling books to his name, including Ego Is The Enemy, The Obstacle Is The Way, and Conspiracy. Making the digestible case for why slowing down is the secret weapon for charging ahead, Ryan’s latest release — aptly titled Stillness Is The Key (hitting bookstores everywhere this week) — is your next must read and read again primer on living your best life.Returning for this third appearance on the podcast (check out RRP #168 and #239), today we explore the essential elements of stillness — and its limitless applications for profound personal self-improvement.Want to avoid distractions? Develop greater insight? Unlock creativity? Improve your decision making? Better your parenting skills? Enhance athletic performance?The incredible power and practicality of cultivating placidity in our increasingly turbulent, tumultuous, reactive, distraction monopolized lives simply cannot be overstated.Stillness is the key.You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I have great fondness for this human.

“I’ve always been a fighter. For some reason, I’ve always wanted to fight and prove that I was strong.”Laila AliHow do you find your path in the vast shadow cast by one of history’s most accomplished and beloved humans?For Laila Ali, the daughter of late global icon and humanitarian Muhammad Ali (the 8th of his 9 children), it wasn’t easy. It wasn’t always pretty. But over time, she found her voice. Staked her claim in very the ring that propelled her father to god-like status. And transcended that shadow as a multi-faceted talent that honors her father and yet is hers alone.Although she was never an athlete growing up — and didn’t take to the pugilistic arts until she was 18 — Laila would become the most successful female in the history of women’s boxing. A 4-time undefeated world champion, she racked up 24 wins, 21 knockouts and zero losses over the course of her storied career.Retirement was just the beginning. Today the mother of two is a fitness & wellness advocate, TV host, home chef, cookbook author, and founder of the Laila Ali Lifestyle Brand.A cultural icon in her own right, Laila currently hosts the Emmy Award Winning show Home Made Simple (which airs every Saturday on the Oprah Winfrey Network) and has appeared on everything from Celebrity Apprentice to Dancing With The Stars as well as Rachael Ray, Dr. Oz, Good Morning America and many other national media outlets.This is a conversation about the interior experience of growing up as a daughter of ‘The Greatest’ — and the pressures and expectations that held.It’s about growing up in a broken household. The troubled youth that followed. Getting arrested. Meeting her bottom in a juvenile detention home. And the journey that followed to recreate herself.It’s about her often misunderstood career as a professional boxer. The entrepreneurism that propels her success. And the legacy she is dedicated to emulating.But more than anything, this is a conversation about mindset. The cultivation of self-belief required to become a champion. Letting go of other’s expectations. Developing the courage to fail. And the tools required to make your unique impact on the world.You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I had a ton of fun with Laila.

“Consciousness is a seed. A seed of infinity with no specific identity and the same vast potential as a seed.”Guru SinghNewly rebranded from Guru Corner to Guru Multiverse — because after all the infinite has no sharp edges — today marks yet another deep dive with Guru Singh, my treasured friend and favorite wizard of all things mystical.For those newer to the show, imagine a modern-day Gandalf who rocks like Hendrix while dropping pearls of wisdom that beautifully fuse Eastern mysticism with Western pragmatism.A celebrated third-generation Sikh yogi, master spiritual teacher, author, and family man, for the past 40 years Guru Singh has been studying and teaching Kundalini Yoga. He is the author of several books, a powerful lecturer, and behind-the-scenes guide to many a luminary, including Fortune 500 CEOs, athletes, and artists.A peer of rock legends like Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead, Guru Singh is also a talented musician who began his recording career on Warner Bros’ Reprise label in the 1960s. When he isn’t recording tracks with people like Seal, he’s bringing down the house on the daily at Yoga West, his Los Angeles home base.Marking his 7th appearance on the show, today’s discourse is an adventure into the very nature of consciousness. It’s vast potential. And the potency it contains to both create and destroy.Because everything that exists in the physical realm is but a manifestation of consciousness, it is this unseen force that is the truth of reality itself. Born as a seed, with the same potential to flower and proliferate.Serving as an ethereal bookend to my recent and more scientific exploration of this subject with Annaka Harris (RRP #460), this discussion explores the spiritual nature, limitless mystery and interconnected design of that which defines everything. Consciousness — human, botanical, animal, elemental and universal. But more than anything, infinite.In addition, we take the liberty of pulling on a few tangential threads, including the power of journaling, the explosion of cancel culture, the importance of maintaining a strong center point, and the transformative power of focusing on human commonalities over the differences that divide us.As always, Guru Singh takes us out with a song, so make sure to stick around to the end.You can watch it all go down on YouTube. And as always, the conversation streams wild and free on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Enjoy!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Appreciation is the purest, strongest form of love. It is the outward-bound kind of love that asks for nothing and gives everything.”Kelly CorriganLove. Connection. Pain.Finding the universal in the specific. And beauty in the mundane.This is but a few of the themes explored today with the woman dubbed ‘the voice of her generation’ by Oprah magazine and ‘the poet laureate of the ordinary’ by HuffPost.Meet Kelly Corrigan.Best known for her insightful, candid takes on the too-often overlooked moments that define our lives, Kelly’s writing spills over with warmth, courage, vulnerability and humor — rendering her many books beloved by millions.A Today Show regular, Kelly has authored a stack of New York Times bestsellers including, The Middle Place, Lift, and Glitter and Glue. Tell Me More, her most recent offering, is a deeply personal and very funny story-driven collection of essays on the twelve powerful phrases we use to sustain our relationships and make love and connection possible.Named one of the best books of 2019 by Real Simple and Bustle, Tell Me More is both a high-recommend and the backdrop for today’s dive into how we can cultivate more meaningful connection and deeper understanding with the people in our lives.I met Kelly exactly a year ago at The Nantucket Project. In addition to being an extraordinary writer, she serves as the creative director of TNP — the right hand to organization founder Tom Scott, who shared his story on the podcast in April, 2018 (episode #360).The latest in my series of guests sourced from this extraordinary event, I was immediately taken by her fun and fearless stage presence. Her curiosity. Her unique insights. And her unmistakeable charm. I knew she would make an amazing guest for the show. Today she delivers.We begin by traversing Kelly’s arc as a writer — how she developed her voice — and her role in shaping TNP.Then we broaden the aperture, exploring her observations and insights into how we relate to the people in our lives — from our loved ones and children, to co-workers and strangers.This is about finding beauty and poetry in the simple things. And why saying things like, ‘I don’t know’ or ‘I was wrong’ or ‘tell me more’ can provide a bedrock for the emotional experiences we seek most, yet too often elude us.Better understanding. Greater empathy. Deeper intimacy. True connection.You can watch it all go down on YouTube.

September 8, 2019

“You don’t change your identity overnight. You have to start with these little keyhole experiments until something that you think that was just an interest becomes a real passion or a vocation.”David EpsteinConventional wisdom dictates that mastery demands an early start. Relentless focus at the exclusion of other pursuits. And as many hours of deliberate practice as humanly possible.Be it violin, painting, basketball or boat building, there’s simply no substitute for a life wholly devoted to developing that narrowly defined skill.Hence the “10,000 hour rule” zeitgeist embrace — an edict divined by psychologist Anders Ericcson and made famous by Malcolm Gladwell.But is this actually true? Today’s guest put this theory to the test, researching the world’s top performers across a wide variety of disciplines to discover a most counter-intuitive truth — that early specialization is actually the exception to the rule. It turns out that the most successful among us are those who developed broad interests and skills while everyone else was rushing to specialize.Today we explore why breadth is the ally of depth – not the opposite. And why generalists are the ones most primed to excel.Enter journalist and multiple New York Times bestselling author, David Epstein.In addition to being an exceptional runner (he set the Columbia University record for 800 meters), David is a former investigative reporter for both ProPublica and Sports Illustrated with master’s degrees in environmental science and journalism. Three of his stories have been optioned for films. And his TED Talk, Are Athletes Really Getting Better, Faster, Stronger? has been viewed over 8 million times (and even shared by Bill Gates).David is currently best known for his two smash-hit bestsellers, The Sports Gene: Inside The Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance and Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World. A #1 New York Times bestseller, Range is arguably the must-read breakout hit of 2019 — a book as much about parenting as it is about performance.This is an insanely informative and engrossing conversation about the benefits of being a generalist — in career, sports, science, art, and life.In a world that heavily favors early specialization, we discuss why it’s often the late bloomers who prevail. Why it’s the jacks-of-all-traders rather than the nose-to-the-grindstoners who ultimately blaze a path to greater success, happiness and fulfillment in both career and life.We discuss David’s infamous debate with Malcolm Gladwell that changed the famous thinker’s mind — and spawned David’s groundbreaking books.We talk about the benefits of inefficiency. Why frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. And why failing isn’t just good, but the best way to learn.Our greatest masters — professional athletes, Nobel laureates, musicians, inventors, and scientists — all resist siloing themselves in a single field. Instead they think broadly. Embrace diverse experiences. And constantly cultivate new interests.My hope is that David’s message will inspire you to do the same.And if you’re a late bloomer like myself, this exchange is certain to reassure and delight.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“The heart is the divine mind, not the brain”Julie PiattHas it really been a full year since Julie appeared on the podcast?Well that’s just not right.So today marks the latest installment in my ongoing series of ponderous mind melds with my wife and in-house spiritual guru, the wise and ethereal Julie Piatt, aka SriMati.Longtime listeners are well acquainted with my better half. For those newer to the show, Julie is many things — the bestselling author of three vegan cookbooks. An accomplished yogi, healer, musician, and mom to four children. The host of the For The Life of Me podcast. And the master of Water Tiger, her online spiritual community where she muses on all matters metaphysical.Julie has a lot to say. And this time it’s personal.This conversation opens with a wide-ranging discussion wherein we take stock of our marriage. Discuss the next evolution of our two-decade relationship. And share our collective experiences to explore relationship fulfillment in general.We talk about low moments – my relapse (almost 8 years ago), grief, rebirth, and divorce. We discuss creativity and taking responsibility for our personal connections. We recap our recent retreat in Italy. And we conclude by diving into Julie’s current obsessions — her For The Life of Me podcast and quickly growing online spiritual community, Water Tiger.And we conclude with a very big announcement.Let me set the stage. As many of you know, Julie spent years devoted to mastering the art of plant-based cheese. That journey birthed This Cheese Is Nuts, her groundbreaking cookbook primer on all things non-dairy. In the years since that book’s publication, she continued to iterate on her recipes, taking her creations next level.The privileged few who have tested her achievements know very well just how insanely delicious it is. People literally freak out. Chances are you’ve even heard a few on mic raves from many a former podcast guest — Julie’s favorite taste testers.The response has been so unanimously positive, she spent the last year assembling the pieces to create her very own direct-to-consumer artisanal plant-based cheese line.It’s called SriMu. It’s launching in mid-November 2019. And she is proud to announce that she is currently taking pre-orders.Unlike anything else in the current marketplace, SriMu artisanal “not cheese” is the next evolution of non-dairy delights. Vegan, paleo, dairy-free, gluten-free and made with mostly organic ingredients, it’s a super-charged, divine offering beautifully packaged in a subscription box. When you sign up, you’ll get three different tiers of extraordinary, next-level plant-based cheese delivered directly to your home on a monthly basis.I am super proud of Julie’s manifestation. It’s going to be huge. I know you’re going to love it. And I wanted my podcast tribe to have the very first opportunity to try what I’ve been (semi-secretly) enjoying for the last year.To learn more and place your order, visit SriMu.com.Now, on to the podcast. The visually inclined can watch it all go down on YouTube.

September 1, 2019

“We can’t have change without loss, which is why so often people say they want change but nonetheless stay exactly the same.”Lori GottliebLet’s talk about talking to someone.Personally, I’ve been in and out of therapy for more than two decades. Over the last couple years, I’ve been deeply immersed in a weekly therapist-led men’s group — intimate game-changing sessions that have helped me work through deep-seated stuff that lives and breathes beyond 12-step.We’re only as sick as our secrets. The path to healing and personal growth requires openly sharing our hidden struggles. Bearing our vulnerabilities. And allowing others to identify the blind spots that elude us.My point is that we all need help. And as today’s guest will openly admit, even therapists benefit from therapy.A Los Angeles-based psychotherapist, journalist and author, Lori Gottlieb writes the weekly ‘Dear Therapist’ column for The Atlantic. She contributes to several prominent publications including The New York Times. And she recurs as a mental health expert on a variety of national television and radio outlets including, The Today Show, Good Morning America, The CBS Early Show, Dr. Phil, CNN, and NPR’s ‘Fresh Air.’In addition, Lori is the author of three books: Marry Him, Stick Figure and her latest, Maybe You Should Talk to Someone, a fun and highly relatable romp behind the scenes of a therapist’s world. What it’s like to be a therapist. And what it’s like to be a therapist in therapy.A hit that spent many weeks on The New York Times bestseller list, the book was listed as People magazine’s ‘Book of the Week.’ O magazine named it one of the ‘Best Nonfiction Books of 2019.’ And it’s currently being developed into a TV series with Eva Longoria.This is a conversation about what happens when a therapist — someone specifically trained to understand what makes people do what they do — experiences her own personal crisis.But it’s also a broader conversation about mental well-being in general. About the benefits of therapy. And why we can all better ourselves by talking to a professional.In addition, we discuss the psychological impact of comparing ourselves to others. Healthy and unhealthy parenting practices. Repairing ruptured relationships. And many other topics.I should note that I did my very best to resist making this a personal therapy session (not easy!).As a final thought: if you are struggling in the darkness, don’t wait to talk to someone. If you’re afraid to shed light on that thing — whether it be anger, shame, addiction, resentment, depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts — don’t wait to talk to someone. Don’t wait until it’s a crisis. Find the courage. Reach out. raise your hand. Help awaits you.You can watch our entire conversation on YouTube. And the episode is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I really enjoyed Lori’s company. My hope is that you find the exchange as entertaining and illuminating as I did.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“We can’t all live in nature but that doesn’t mean we can’t all live naturally.”Tony RiddleScreens and cubicles. Shoes and chairs. Fluorescent lights and air conditioned offices. Processed foods. Netflix and chill.Disconnecting us from our essential human nature, modern living isn’t making us happier. Ironically, it’s driving an existential crisis of unprecedented proportions —  rendering us more sick, immobile, lonely, depressed, and unfulfilled than ever.It’s time to stop. It’s time we reconnect with that which is most essential.Nature. Movement. Community. Love.To do that, we must adopt a more naturalistic approach to lifestyle.This week’s guest calls it rewilding.Meet Tony Riddle – a natural lifestyle coach and barefoot running enthusiast who has devoted his life to studying what makes us human and how to live naturally in the modern world. Through the adoption of simple practices — many of which defined humanity for millennia — he aids people in living healthier and more connected lives by changing our relationship to ourselves, to others and our personal environments.Putting his life philosophy into action, Tony is attempting to run the entire length of Great Britain, barefoot. Beginning September 1 at Land’s End, he will run 900 miles — 30 miles a day for 30 consecutive days — until he reaches John O’Groats, convening with sustainability experts along the way. To learn more, join him for a segment or otherwise get involved, visit tonyriddle.com.
I was initially  introduced to Tony through The Happy Pear twins. Enamored with his instructional Instagram tutorials on natural lifestyle practices, I knew he’d make for a fun and highly instructive podcast.My day with Tony began with a running technique tutorial, followed by a trail run (which Tony did barefoot of course, to my amazement given the sharp rocky terrain), and culminated in this conversation.As an aside, please check out the fun and informative video we created from my run with Tony. It’s called You’ve Been Running Wrong. Shout out to Ali Rogers for a bang up job directing and editingThis is a conversation about the importance of getting back to what works best for our bodies by deepening our natural and ancient connection to ourselves, to others and our environments. It begins with getting outdoors. But it extends from there — to movement, to food (of course), sleep, digestion, parenting, play, and even the re-configuration of our homes and workplaces.Tony’s Tutorials: As a gesture of thanks for listening, Tony set up a special discount on his squat and running video tutorials.

August 21, 2019

“It doesn’t matter what other people think. Not everyone is going to always support you 100% but as long as you are doing you and you know that you’re becoming a better person then that’s what’s important.” Gwen JorgensenHow does a relatively conservative, risk averse person evolve into an unbreakable champion? Someone confident enough to put everything on the line for an audacious dream?This is the story of Gwen Jorgensen — an accountant turned ‘Queen of Triathlon’ who walked away from swim-bike-run at the peak of her powers to ply her skills in an entirely new discipline: the marathon.Gwen’s athletic career began as a swimmer, competing at the University of Wisconsin as a walk on before making the switch to track & field, maturing into an NCAA standout and Big 10 Champion. But the end of college marked the end of her athletic ambitions. Declining a professional running career, she opted for civilian life, joining Ernst & Young as a CPA.Eventually, USA Triathlon lured Gwen back to athletics. Within two years, Gwen made her first Olympic team and matured into the sport’s dominant force, accumulating 2 Triathlon World Champion titles and 17 ITU World Triathlon Series wins, culminating in gold at the 2016 Games in Rio.After a year off racing to give birth to her son Stanley, Gwen announced her retirement from triathlon, along with a brazen new goal: to win marathon gold in Tokyo. It’s a feat no American woman has accomplished since Joan Benoit Samuelson broke the tape at the inaugural women’s marathon at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympiad.A few weeks ago I was invited by Jaybird Sport to join a group of adventure-seeking endurance junkies in Montana’s Glacier National Park. The official occasion was to celebrate the launch of Jaybird’s new Vista wireless earbuds (which I’m loving by the way). The unofficial occasion was to retreat and connect — old-school, analog campfire style — with like-minded, high vibration humans. It’s a group that included Gwen and husband Patrick Lemieux, as well as a few former podcast guests like Knox Robinson (RRP #394), Timothy Olson (RRP #78), and Sanjay Rawal (RRP #389).This podcast is a product of that uniquely beautiful experience — a great conversation and audience Q&A conducted outdoors with my fellow Jaybird retreat attendees.It’s about Gwen’s career. Her philosophy on training and racing. Overcoming injury. And the why behind her decision to pursue the marathon.It’s about how her ambitious dream was received by the running community, and what she has learned training alongside legends like Shalane Flanagan at the Bowerman Track Club.It’s about her ‘Champion Only’ mindset. The nature of her motivation. The importance of agency — the freedom to forge her own unique path. And why this power is so crucial to Gwen’s success and happiness.Finally, we explore how she balances her career as a full-time professional athlete against marriage, family and motherhood — and the crucial role Gwen’s husband Patrick (who makes a cameo appearance) plays in her success equation.But most of all, this is an exploration of the tension between risk and certainty. The rare courage required to walk away from success. To gamble one’s future. And pursue the heart.This episode is audio only, available everywhere you listen to fine podcasts, including of course Apple Podcasts and Spotify.This exchange was a highlight of my Montana experience. I sincerely hope you enjoy it as much as I did.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

97,Humble The Poet,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/humble-the-poet-461/,"Episode 461
August 18, 2019

“We all have the unlimited power to shift our perspective, and with that the unlimited power to change the way we feel about life.” Humble The PoetWe craft our identity around story. And that story is comprised of beliefs. But you are not your beliefs. And that story isn’t just incomplete, it’s generally wrong.The path to self-actualization requires deconstructing that story. And disentangling your beliefs from the truth of your highest self.To do this we must unlearn much of what we reflexively accept as truth. And open ourselves to a more expansive perspective.My guest for this exploration is the Toronto-based, rapper, author and spoken word artist, Kanwer Singh, known broadly as Humble The Poet.Covered in tattoos, a thick beard, and Sikh head wrap, Humble commands attention with his silly smile and warm, inviting presence. A former school teacher turned artist, he challenges conventional wisdom with dynamic live sets that simultaneously entertain while questioning the status quo.Humble shares his distinctive style and point of view on his wildly popular blog. He’s been featured on a multitude of media outlets, including CBC’s Canada Reads, as well as on Apple’s first Canadian ad spot for their #ShotOnIphone campaign. He’s the author of Unlearn: 101 Simple Truths for A Better Life* and the upcoming book, Things No One Else Can Teach Us*, hitting bookstores everywhere October 15, 2019 and available for pre-order now.Flipping the script for happiness, Humble’s point is simple — our hardest moments are our greatest teachers, because they invite us to change our perspectives. We can’t control the setbacks in life but we do have the power to control how we react to them.It’s a process that begins with unlearning what we think we know. And being open to a new story — about ourselves, others and the world we share.This is a fun and wide-ranging conversation about that very shift. Sharing raw and honest stories from his own life — from his rocky start to becoming a rapper to nearly going broke to his worst breakups — it’s an exploration of how a change in mindset can radically alter our outlook.It’s about arresting our negative impulses to see the positive opportunity in everything.It’s about the power of gratitude and mindfulness.It’s about art, creativity, and authenticity.It’s about the difference between paying attention and getting attention.But mostly, it’s about the power of story. How you are not your beliefs. What we all may need to unlearn. And how a change in perspective about one’s own story can transform everything.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/humblethepoet461 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Humble brings great energy.

August 11, 2019

“Sometimes, we have to completely let go of intuitions that are actually giving us false information about reality.” Annaka HarrisWhat is consciousness? How does it arise? And why does it exist?We take ‘experience’ for granted. But the very existence of consciousness raises profound questions: Why would any collection of matter in the universe be conscious? How are we able to think about this? And why should we?Our guide for today’s philosophic and scientific exploration of these mysteries is Annaka Harris.An editor and consultant for science writers specializing in neuroscience and physics, Annaka is the author of the children’s book I Wonder, a collaborator on the Mindful Games Activity Cards, by Susan Kaiser Greenland, and a volunteer mindfulness teacher for the Inner Kids organization.Annaka’s work has appeared in The New York Times and all of her guided meditations and lessons for children are available on the Waking Up app, the digital meditation platform created by her husband Sam Harris — the renown author, public intellectual, blogger, and podcast host.Annaka’s latest book — which recently hit the New York Times bestseller list and provides the focus for today’s conversation — is entitled, Conscious: A Brief Guide to the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind. A must-read for any and all curious about one of the Universe’s great mysteries, it’s a brief yet mind-bending read that challenges our assumptions about the nature, origin and purpose of consciousness.Equal parts nerdy and fun, this is a deeply profound conversation that tackles the very nature of consciousness itself — and what it means to be a living being having ‘an experience’.We discuss how Annaka became interested in this field and the path undertaken to writing this book.Parsing instinct from scientific fact, we deconstruct our assumptions about consciousness and grapple with its essential nature — what is consciousness exactly? And where does it physically reside?We discuss meditation and artificial intelligence. We dive into plant consciousness. We explore panpsychism (a theory I quite fancy). And we muse about the role of spirituality in scientific inquiry.All told, this tackles the current limits of science and human understanding and leaves us wondering, is it possible to truly understand everything?The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/annakaharris460 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.An intellectual delight from start to finish, I thoroughly enjoyed talking to Annaka and I sincerely hope you enjoy the listen.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

99,Amanda Palmer,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/amanda-palmer-459/,"Episode 459
August 8, 2019

“We will stay crippled in the darkness if we cannot feel compassion for the heart that is the darkest.” Amanda PalmerToday’s guest is many things. A fiercely independent singer, songwriter and musician. A bestselling author and blogger. A playwright and director. A riveting speaker and a viral TED Talk-er. A crowdfunding mom. An ardent feminist. And a fearless activist.Living and breathing at the cutting edge of expression in all forms, Amanda Palmer is an iconic, bold and sui generis performer constantly innovating what it means to be an artist in the modern age.Getting her start as a busking eight-foot bride statue in Harvard Square, she would go on to form one-half of the inventive, punk cabaret act The Dresden Dolls before launching one of the most successful crowd-funded solo careers in music history.Leaning into her devoted audience to support her seemingly endless fount of creativity, Amanda helped resuscitate the ancient art of artistic patronage, giving us all permission to ask. And more importantly perhaps, the encouragement to receive.Further to this idea, The Art of Asking, Amanda’s sensational 2013 TED Talk, would go on to be viewed over 20 million times and led to her New York Times bestselling memoir, The Art of Asking: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Let People Help*.Leveraging her legion of 15,000 Patreon supporters, Amanda’s career is wholly devoted to her adoring fans eager to support her creations. Her latest offering, There Will Be No Intermission, is a beautiful, haunting and powerful solo album and world tour that grapples with the very personal and social emotional landscape of abortion, miscarriage and death.This past May I had the good fortune to witness Amanda’s epic 4 1/2 hour show at the Ace Theatre here in LA. I was extremely moved by it. And even more privileged to host this conversation with her the following day.This is a conversation about what it means to be radically compassionate — open-hearted to even those we deem undeserving — and why humanity depends on empathy for its survival.It’s about the strength that can be gathered when we’re courageous enough to be truly vulnerable.It’s about the perniciousness of perfectionism — the true enemy of creative expression.Why asking help is so hard, but crucial — also welcome.And some uncomfortable truths about my hero Henry David Thoreau. Hint: it involves donuts.In the spirit of vulnerability, I’ll freely admit I was a bit nervous and intimidated — I mean who wouldn’t be?Nonetheless, it was an honor to spend an hour with one of the great creative voices of our time. I’m delighted to share the experience with you today.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/amandapalmer459 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Enjoy!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

100,Toby Morse,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/toby-morse-458/,"Episode 458
August 5, 2019

“The key to being positive and happy is doing what you love. I’m very lucky to still be able to do that. I don’t have a ‘Plan B’. I never really had one. I just live my life.” Toby MorseTattoos. High intensity sound. Stage diving. For the unfamiliar, it’s chaos. Scary. Violent, even. But to today’s guest, being hardcore straight edge is magical — a grassroots community dedicated to art, not anarchy. Celebrating life. And making the world a better place.Best known around the world as the charismatic, energetic and always smiling front man for hardcore punk band H2O, Toby Morse was raised by a single mom in Massachusetts before moving to New York City in 1988 with a dream of becoming a musician. Immersing himself in the burgeoning punk rock scene of Manhattan’s Lower East Side, he worked odd jobs. He was a roadie. And in 1994, inspired by Bad Brains, he formed a band that would ultimately become synonymous with the Straight Edge and Positive Mental Attitude (‘PMA”) movements.Their self-titled debut album came out in 1996. Over the years, H2O has played alongside acts like No Doubt and Misfits. In 1998 and 1999 they joined the Warped Tour. Still together, the band continues to pack venues the world over, including a recent European tour that featured Toby’s teenage son Max on drums.A dedicated vegan who has never himself touched drugs or alcohol, Toby is also a family man, self-professed “Emo Dad” and the founder of One Life One Chance — a non-profit dedicated to inspiring elementary, middle and high school students to make healthy choices and live a drug-free life. Through public speaking engagements, Toby informs kids how possible it is to maintain PMA, break stereotypes, be a leader, and maintain self-respect.Toby first came on my radar a couple years ago by way of podcast favorite, Cro-Mags frontman and fellow hardcore PMA warrior John Joseph. A friend of JJ’s is a friend of mine, so I got hip to Toby’s Instagram and quickly fell in love with his consistent flow of uplifting posts. His family-centric high vibe. The gentle, beautiful and uncompromising way he celebrates individuality, honoring the misfits and uplifting the weirdos. And his unwavering commitment to serving kids with his enthusiastic message of hope and positivity.I needed to know more.So here we are.Of course, this is a conversation about Toby’s life. Being raised by older brothers who taught him to skate, introduced him to the music that would define his life and scared him straight. It’s about what he learned about life from Bad Brains, Cro-Mags and Napoleon Hill. It’s about veganism. Parenting. Art. And, of course, PMA.But most of all, this is a conversation about honoring non-conformity — exalting what makes you uniquely you. It’s about the importance of community and family. And it’s about the courage to blaze your own path.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/tobymorse458 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.One thing is for sure — I’ve found a new friend in Toby. I’m inspired by his wisdom and example. And I’m honored to share his extraordinary life with you today.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

101,Titus Welliver,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/titus-welliver-457/,"Episode 457
July 29, 2019

“Gratitude and humility attract opportunity and success.” Titus WelliverHey it’s that guy. You know the guy, right?The guy with the crazy moustache in that Ben Affleck movie? The Man In Black from Lost? The Irish gangster in Sons of Anarchy?Oh, right. THAT GUY.Titus Welliver has one of the longest lists of working actor credits in Hollywood. Nonetheless, this über-talented veteran of stage and screen spent most of his storied career slightly outside Tinsletown’s white hot spotlight.But that changed with the 2014 premier of Amazon’s Original Series Bosch. A hardboiled noir crime procedural based on a series of Michael Connelly novels, the show caught fire and is currently in production on its sixth season. Suffice it to say, Titus’ heavily lauded portrayal of  L.A.P.D. detective Harry Bosch landed him center on the zeitgeist stage.But this man is much more than an amazing actor finally enjoying his moment. He is a friend. And a true artist.Raised by a fashion illustrator mom and celebrated landscape painter Neil Welliver, Titus spent his formative years surrounded by a community of influential poets, writers, photographers and fine artists. Initially a painter himself, his father taught young Titus early and often that creative mastery required discipline. Patience. And a work ethic as rugged as New England winters.Perhaps an artist’s life was pre-destined for Titus. But his early passion for painting would eventually be displaced by a love of theater.It’s a career that would eventually put him on a trajectory to work alongside some of the most brilliant minds in storytelling. People like David Milch, the creator of NYPD Blue, Deadwood and John From Cincinatti, who would become a father figure to Titus. Steven Bochco, producer of Hill Street Blues and L.A. Law. And Ben Affleck, who has cast Titus in all of his movies: Gone Baby Gone, The Town and Argo.In fact, it’s been said that Titus has appeared in literally everything.This is a conversation about what it means to live a creative life. What is required to succeed an artist. And what it’s like to devote your life to mastering a craft.We talk about how personal loss and fatherhood informs his process. Why gratitude and humility attract opportunity. And the importance of self-confidence, belief and personal drive in the artistic success equation.While art is subjective, not all art warrants merit. Bad art exists. And there is indeed an objective truth to good art.Titus is dedicated to this ethos. Today he shares his story.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/TitusWelliver457 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I love this man. And it’s a privilege to share his wisdom and experience with you today.

102,"Zach Bush, MD",https://www.richroll.com/podcast/zach-bush-456/,"Episode 456
July 25, 2019

“The biggest problem we all face is the story that we tell ourselves of what our lives have been. It’s keeping us in a box. The ‘cubicle’ you’re really living in is your story.” Zach Bush, MDHe’s back! One of the most fascinating and popular guests to grace this platform, Today Zach Bush, MD returns for a third mind-altering bend around the multiverse.For the uninitiated, Zach’s varied interests belie attempts to properly define him — but I’ll give it a try. One of the few triple board certified physicians in America with expertise in Internal Medicine, Endocrinology and Metabolism, and Hospice/Palliative care, he is the founder and director of M Clinic integrative health center in Virginia.In addition to his experience in functional medicine, longevity, autism, gut health, cancer, and many other areas of medicine, he is an avid environmentalist and activist involved in a multitude of projects that focus on ecology, regenerative agriculture, farmer well-being and spirituality.To advocate for soil health & food independence, Zach is also the creator of Farmer’s Footprint. Seen through the lens of farmers and their communities, it’s a documentary series & grassroots movement that evaluates the impact of monocrop farming and pesticide reliance on chronic disease and planetary health — while simultaneously exploring evidence-based solutions to rebuild living biodiversity and ultimately reverse climate change.But more than anything, Zach is a healer. A master consciousness. A gift to humanity. And someone I am very proud to call friend.Zach’s initial appearance on the podcast (RRP 353) blew minds across the world. Our second conversation (RRP 414) was one of the most moving conversations of my life. So it just seemed right to invite Zach and his holistic health coach, consultant and yoga teacher wife Jenn Perell Bush to join us on our recent retreat in Italy.If you listened to either of our previous conversations, it would be reasonable to expect this discussion to further explore the impact of industrialized food systems on human and ecological health. However, that assumption would be wrong.Instead, we delve inside to explore our individual and collective experience with pain, both psychic and physical.We deconstruct our unhealthy obsession with comfort.We stress test the stories we craft that form our identity, stunt our evolution, and ultimately hold us hostage.And we explore a new path to freedom — liberation from that which ails us so that we can self-actualize, and together embrace our inherent divinity.Akin to the recent episode with Gemma Newman, MD (RRP 449), this exchange was recorded before a live audience of retreat attendees in Italy (thus audio only) and concludes with Zach leading a meditation, edited down for time and the sake of the listener.In closing, I want to express gratitude for our extraordinary Plantpower Italia community, who were collectively moved to donate $81,000 towards Zach’s Farmer’s Footprint organization and docu-series. On behalf of Zach, Jenn and the organization, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. If Zach’s message moves you to get involved, you can learn more and donate at farmersfootprint.usThis is one is deep. Perhaps a bit different from what you’ve come to expect from Dr. Zach. But I’m confident you’re going to leave this conversation changed for the better. Words cannot express my gratitude for this man. And it’s my honor to share his wisdom with you today.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

103,Matthew Futterman,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/matthew-futterman-455/,"Episode 455
July 22, 2019

“Where you’re born, how you’re born and how you grew up are not your destiny. You can change your destiny. If you do the work, you can be better tomorrow than you were yesterday.” Matthew FuttermanWhat is the secret to running impossibly fast? Or distances longer than previously imagined?Beginning in the 1960’s, an unknown farm boy turned coach named Bob Larsen launched a decades-long quest to find the ‘secret sauce’ of speed and endurance that would eventually revolutionize the sport and catapult American running onto the national stage.This is the story of how Larsen took turned a rag-tag group of also-ran junior college athletes called the Jamul Toads into cult-favorite national champions. Later, he would apply his secret training regimen to athletes like Meb Keflezighi and Deena Kastor to create victories at the New York and Boston Marathons as well as the Olympics.To unpack this incredible yarn, today I sit down with New York Times Deputy Sports Editor Matthew Futterman.A graduate of Union College and Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, Matthew has previously worked for The Wall Street Journal, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and the Star-Ledger of New Jersey, where he was a part of the team that won the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News in 2005.An avid marathoner, Matthew became obsessed with the history of American distance running and the training innovations that create champions. The result of this quest is his new book, Running to the Edge: A Band of Misfits and the Guru Who Unlocked the Secrets of Speed. Part Bob Larsen biography and part autobiography, it’s a fascinating account of how one maverick coach discovered and developed the unorthodox paradigm that would launch American runners to unprecedented breakthroughs and ultimately inform the protocols of some of today’s most fleet of foot.From Bob Bowerman and Steve Prefontaine to the quest to break the 2-hour marathon, today’s exploration focuses on the science behind running performance. The ongoing quest to find the secret sauce of speed and endurance. And the evolving crusade to run faster and farther than ever before.It’s about what can be learned from Bob Larsen’s example, and the methods he pioneered that led to his stature as one of the greatest running coaches of all time.And it’s about our shared love for the sport of running.Even if running isn’t your thing, I think you will find this conversation compelling. The stories are legend. And the life lessons applicable across disciplines.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/matthewfutterman455 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

July 15, 2019

“The more you can be in this present moment and control what you can control, the better off you’re going to be.” Mike LeeTo be totally honest, I don’t follow the pugilistic arts all that closely. But professional boxer barely describes this week’s guest — a man who has faced stacked odds and overcome career-ending setbacks to meet the biggest moment of his life.Ask him how he did it, and Mike Lee answers with conviction: it’s all about mindset.A professional light heavyweight boxer currently 21 – 0 with 11 knockouts, this Saturday, July 20th Mike will be fighting for his first world title against Caleb Plant — the current Undefeated IBF Super Middleweight World Champion. It’s Mike’s first fight in 13 months. On the other hand, Plant (18-0 with 10 knockouts) is fresh off his biggest victory. Suffice it to say, it’s shaping up to be quite the bout. And it’s all going down live on Fox PBC, live from the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.Hardly your average fighter, what compels me about Mike is the unique path he’s blazed to arrive at this place. This is a guy who studied business at Notre Dame, where he relaxed by reading The Wall Street Journal and watching CNBC. When he graduated in 2009 with a 3.8 GPA in finance, he was welcomed with lucrative opportunities on Wall Street. But then he takes the road less traveled, turning every job offer down to pursue a lifelong dream: winning Chicago’s Golden Gloves.He did just that. The following year, he went pro, winning his first two professional fights. The national spotlight shone bright. Endorsement contracts followed. The boxing world, it appeared, was his oyster.You might say the rest is history. But that belies the severity of his next bout — a fight for his life that blindsided him outside the ring.At the peak of his career, after knocking out Tyler Seever in 2012, Mike fell prey to a mysterious health condition that would bench him for over two years. Experiencing great pain in his joints, severe headaches and debilitating chronic fatigue, doctors struggled to determine the cause. Some believed it was psychological. Others prescribed a multitude of drugs, none of which resolved his underlying predicament. But all of them told him he would never fight again. The hospital bed had become home. His identity challenged, he suddenly felt worthless, succumbing to a deep depression.Nonetheless, Mike never gave up hope. He committed to seeking alternative and non-traditional solutions, which culminated in a diagnosis: an auto-immune disease called Ankylosing Spondylitis. A version of arthritis, AS can be devastating both physically and mentally for anyone, let alone a professional athlete who pushes his body to the limit every day.The path forward hasn’t been easy. Mike wakes up in pain every day. But he’s gone all in on this comeback. And that’s something worth all of us getting behind.Layered with life lessons and formative takeaways, this is a conversation about the value of perseverance. It’s about deploying a potent mindset to keep your dream live, no matter the circumstances. It’s about visualizing success. And it’s about the importance of always giving back.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/mikelee454 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.An exemplary ambassador of sport, I really enjoyed Mike. I think you will too. And don’t forget to tune in to Fox PBC this Saturday, July 20 to watch him put that mindset into action.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

105,Jeff Gordinier,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/jeff-gordinier-453/,"Episode 453
July 11, 2019

“You are here now. Make the most of it and change what’s not working. It’s crucial.”Jeff GordinierWhy is great food important? How and why did restaurants become culturally significant? And what life lessons can be gleaned from the world’s greatest chef?There is no more enthusiastic ringmaster for this exploration than the merry man of food himself, Jeff Gordinier.A writer, journalist and author who sits at the converging junction of food and culture, Jeff is a frequent contributor to the New York Times and currently serves as the Food and Drinks editor at Esquire Magazine.A graduate of Princeton University where he studied writing and poetry, Jeff is a former writer and editor for Entertainment Weekly, editor at large for Details magazine and over the years has written about music and culture for a multitude of national publications, including Travel + Leisure, GQ, Elle, Creative Nonfiction, Spin, Poetry Foundation, Fortune, and many others.The occasion for today’s conversation is Jeff’s new book, Hungry: Eating, Road-Tripping, and Risking It All with the Greatest Chef in the World*. Equal parts mid-life crisis autobiography, adventure travelogue and biography, it chronicles the four years Jeff spent traveling with René Redzepi, the renowned chef of Copenhagen’s Noma — recently fêted as the #2 best restaurant in the world — in search of the most tantalizing flavors the world has to offer. And yet, the book really isn’t about food. A meditation on risk, re-invention, creative breakthroughs, and human connection, it sits atop my recommended summer reads.I first met Jeff in 2015 when he visited our home for a New York Times feature he was penning on the rise of veganism. Dubbed Vegans Go Glam, the piece caught fire, including a day spent as the #1 most e-mailed story on the entire New York Times website. Suffice it say, this was an insanely big moment for us, and the plant-based movement at large.In the aftermath of that experience, Jeff and I struck up a friendship  He sent me an early copy of Hungry, which I devoured. It left me wanting to know more about Jeff. About food culture. About the mysterious René Redzepi. And what can be learned about life from this charismatic, cult-like genius redefining cutting-edge cuisine.So here we are. This is a conversation about total commitment to mastery. It’s about creative expression. It’s about the cruciality of constant, fearless re-invention. It’s about investing in experience. And it’s about the importance of deep human connection — to others, oneself, and the environment we share.As an anecdotal aside, it is this conversation that inspired my recent and uncharacteristically spontaneous decision to join Jeff and fellow food writer Adam Platt in Copenhagen a few weeks back. A once-in-a-lifetime, seat of our pants adventure I won’t soon forget, we toured the city with René and his head fermentation wizard David Zilber (a seriously fascinating dude in his own right). We experienced the Noma phenomenon behind the scenes. And we enjoyed the premier of the restaurant’s new forage-forward Plant Kingdom menu — a truly psychedelic experience incomparable to anything I have previously encountered. For more, view my Instagram Highlights and check out Dinner With the Disciples, Adam’s piece on the adventure in New York Magazine.In the wake of my visit to Copenhagen, I now fully grok Jeff’s loyal discipleship of René and all things Noma. As counter-intuitive as it may sound, it’s actually not about snobby elitist cuisine. Noma is not just a restaurant. It’s a performance art installation. It’s a community. And it’s a movement — a philosophy of food and life that values connection, nature’s cycles and the unimagined extraordinary.Jeff is a great dude. He’s lived a very interesting life. And he is an exceptional conversationalist.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/jeffgordinier453 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.This conversation — from R.E.M. to Redzepi and everything in between — is just pure, unadulterated joy.I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed having it.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

106,Miguel McKelvey,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/miguel-mckelvey-452/,"Episode 452
July 8, 2019

“What I really care about is connecting people.”Miguel McKelveyThe tectonic plates of the workplace landscape are rapidly shifting. Gone are the days of multi-decade corporate allegiance, replaced with project-based careers. The rapid rise of the freelance economy. And a labor core increasingly distributed across the globe.What are the economic and social implications of this trend? How can the traditional office be re-imagined to fit this escalating movement? And what role can architecture and design play to deepen community and foster personal happiness?There is no better steward to explore these important questions than this week’s guest, Miguel McKelvey.A talented, multi-disciplinary designer and entrepreneur, Miguel is the Co-Founder of WeWork — the ubiquitous, communal co-working space company — where he currently serves as the Chief Culture Officer, directing construction, architecture and web design for the business.Raised on a commune in Oregon, Miguel earned a Bachelor of Architecture degree from the University of Oregon, where he played on the Oregon Ducks basketball team for two years. Prior to WeWork, Miguel created the design framework and led the national retail roll-out for 170 American Apparel stores. Subsequently, he was involved in the early-stage development of several companies, including Green Desk, Barre3, Versation, and English, Baby!Because Miguel shares responsibility for creating and leading one of the world’s most successful companies, one might predictably suspect this is a conversation about business. It is not. To be sure, we track his entrepreneurial journey. But this man’s success has less to do with commerce and more to do with purpose. A deep commitment to community. And an intentional life devoted to fostering meaningful human connection.Over the course of two and a half hours, we explore how Miguel’s unusual upbringing in a five-mother commune and his experience playing NCAA Division I basketball created the ‘Communitarian’ philosophy that would later inform the cultural foundation for WeWork.We discuss Miguel’s love of architecture and the important role design plays in modeling our professional and personal lives. How growing up in the town that produced Nike inspired an entrepreneurial drive to create an aspirational brand. And what his career at American Apparel taught him about engaging consumer culture at scale.But more than anything, this is a conversation with a remarkably humble man driven by gratitude and purpose to create new and original habitats that fuel a more connected world — and ultimately more fulfilling lives.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/miguelmckelvey452 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Final Thing (and it’s a big one): I’m excited to announce my first LIVE SHOW will take place on the evening of Friday, September 27, 2019 at the gorgeous and historic 1,100 seat Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles.

107,Dave Roll,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/dave-roll-451/,"Episode 451
June 30, 2019

“Character matters.”Dave RollFor reasons both obvious and perhaps less so, this week’s episode holds a very special place in my heart.There is something unique about sitting before a microphone that permits a species of conversation difficult to otherwise have. Done right, the inherent formality of putting it all on the record can countenance an experience of rare intimacy that scarcely transpires in the course of conventional human interaction.From the very beginning of this podcast journey, I’ve longed to host my father on the show. To provide a ceremonial opportunity to probe his life, uninterrupted. To learn things about him I’ve always wanted to know — but for whatever reason just never found the right occasion to ask.For years, I harbored the fear that if I didn’t make such an experience a priority, it might never happen. And that would be something I would deeply regret for the rest of my days.My drive was never to share such an experience with an audience. I wasn’t convinced the conversation I yearned for would be appropriate for public consumption. It’s always been about creating a moment just for us. A document I could privately keep for posterity. And for my children.However, a compelling reason recently arose to transform this rumination into reality.A gentleman and a scholar, Dave Roll has spent the better part of his life studying history. The apex of this passion is an incredible new book entitled, George Marshall: Defender of the Republic*. An enthralling and deeply thoughtful chronicle of America’s most distinguished soldier since George Washington, it’s also a deeply prescient and timely meditation on selflessness, leadership, and the momentous importance of moral character in political and social structures. The embodiment of these ideals, Marshall influenced the course of two world wars, and helped define the American century.By way of background, my dad has enjoyed a very successful 35 year career as an accomplished attorney in the field of antitrust. Over the years, he successfully defended clients in investigations and enforcement actions brought by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. After government service at the FTC he matriculated to partner and ultimately managing partner of the prestigious Washington, D.C.- based international law firm Steptoe & Johnson. Later in his career, he founded the Lex Mundi Pro Bono Foundation, a non-profit, public interest organization that provides pro bono legal services to social entrepreneurs around the world.Now in his third act, Dave is enjoying a successful career as an author. Also historical biographies, his previous titles include The Hopkins Touch: Harry Hopkins and the Forging of the Alliance to Defeat Hitler* and Louis Johnson and the Arming of America*, a biography of Harry Truman’s defense secretary.Hitting bookstores July 9 (and available for pre-order now), the Marshall book presents an opportunity for my dad to join the ranks of the great historical biographers of our age. Enjoying unbelievable early praise, its received glowing blurbs from notable figures like General Stanley McCrystal, General David Petraeus, William Hitchcock and Walter Isaacson.Fathers and sons. We’ve gone through it over the years. I’ve put him through more than I care to recall. And he didn’t always make it easy for me. But after weathering extended periods of, let’s just call it strain, we’ve arrived at a very good place. Perspective and age have brought us close. And thus the timing for this conversation could not be more perfect.Equal parts personal and instructive, this conversation traverses Dave’s experience growing up as a Baby Boomer in the post WWII era. It tracks the emotional history of our relationship. And it then pivots to what can be gleaned from the life of George Marshall. How the example set by America’s greatest statesman informs how we think about current politics. The importance of moral leadership as we march towards another election cycle. And ultimately, why character matters.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/daveroll451 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Dad, you truly are a gentleman and a scholar.I am so incredibly proud of you.I’m thrilled to share our exchange.And I love you more than you know.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

June 23, 2019

“Affecting my physical body is a way for me to reach inside my soul. Suffering allows me to access who I am emotionally.”Rebecca RuschThis week I sit down with Rebecca Rusch — one of the world’s greatest adventure athletes.Rebecca is a 7-time World Champion, best-selling author, activist, and Emmy winner. In addition to superhuman success on a mountain bike, she has performed at the elite level across a multitude of disciplines including rock climbing, white water rafting, and multi-day adventure events like Eco Challenge.Still crushing it at 50, Rebecca is redefining human capability in real time.Beyond athletics, Rebecca is a TEDx speaker, author of Rusch To Glory* and the founder of the Be Good Foundation. In addition, she is the event producer of Rebecca’s Private Idaho, a bike race in her hometown of Ketchum, and the protagonist in Blood Road, an extraordinary documentary that chronicles her 1,800 km mountain bike adventure along the Ho Chi Minh Trail to reach the site where her U.S. Air Force pilot father was shot down in Laos more than 40 years earlier during Vietnam.Dubbed ‘The Queen of Pain’ by Adventure Sports magazine, Rebecca was named #6 on Active.com’s list of the World’s Top 100 Athletes, Singletrack.com’s Mountain Biker of the Year, Sports Illustrated Adventure Racing Team of the Year, and Outside magazine’s Top 20 Female Athletes of the Year.Rebecca’s accomplishments are beyond impressive. But today’s conversation lives beyond elite performance to explore things like curiosity. The richness of adventure. Feeding the soul. Continuous personal growth. Redefining age. Contributing to the greater good. And giving back.But most of all, this is about what can be gleaned by leaning into the unknown. And living outside the comfort zone. Because there is so much more to this incredible woman than athletic prowess.I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Rebecca. My hope is that it leaves you re-evaluating your personal limits. And inspired to live more adventurously.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/rebeccarusch450 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

June 20, 2019

“Stay positive. Make a change for yourself. Tell others about your change. Feel good and hopefully, the message will spread.”Gemma NewmanRecorded live during our recent Plantpower Italia retreat in Tuscany, I’m delighted to share a fun and highly informative conversation and audience Q&A with the delightful, whip-smart “Plant Power Doctor” herself.Gemma Newman, MD has worked in medicine for 15 years, the last decade serving as Senior Partner at a family medical practice in the U.K.. She studied at the University of Wales College of Medicine and has worked in many specialities as a doctor including elderly care, endocrinology, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, general surgery, urology, vascular surgery, rehabilitation medicine and General Practice.In recent years she has developed a specialist interest in plant-based nutrition and lifestyle medicine, serving as a Jikiden Reiki practitioner and advisory board member of Plant Based Health Professionals UK. On the daily, she provides evidence based nutrition, mental and physical health modalities, energetic healing and lifestyle advice to her patients, who have gained tremendous results using the power of their plate.As a broadcaster and writer she has been featured on numerous national press outlets including ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky News Sunrise. She is a regular contributor Glamour, Zest and Health magazines and has appeared in the feature film Vegan 2018.Gemma’s journey to plant-based advocacy isn’t rooted in ideology or moral compunction, but rather on hard science matched with self-experimentation.As a young doctor in a high-pressure environment, like many newly minted physicians she began neglecting her own health. Struggling with her weight, and having bought into the background hum of ‘cut the carbs’, she adopted a low carb diet. Calorie counting ensued, combined with a modest daily exercise routine.It worked. Sort of. Dropping from a size 18 to a size 8, she was feeling pretty good about herself. Then she checked her blood profile to discover an elevated lipid profile, markers suggesting a tendency to heart disease. She shrugged off to genetics. Both her father and grandfather died relatively young of atherosclerosis. It’s just something I was born with. Something I just have to live with.Nonetheless, she couldn’t shake the feeling that perhaps there was something she could do to alter this seemingly immutable fate.Meanwhile, Gemma’s husband Richard picked up a little book called Finding Ultra while training for the London Marathon. He decided to give this plant-based diet thing a whirl. Being the skeptical doctor she is, Gemma was less than enthusiastic.Where would he get his protein? Won’t there be nutritional deficiencies? We will never be invited to friend’s houses for dinner ever again! How would I feed my family? Undeterred, Richard completed that marathon, slicing an incredible one hour and ten minutes off his personal best.This got Gemma’s attention.She had already been passionate about researching lifestyle medicine. How changes in stress, sleep, exercise and diet could improve health for a long time. But nothing was to prepare her for the powerful transformations that were possible when people embraced a whole-food plant-based diet.Hence ensued a deep dive into medical literature, scientific research, and self-experimentation.Today we explore the result of Gemma’s journey. How it transformed her life and medical practice wholesale. And the simple changes you can make and sustain to improve your well-being for the long-term.Note: this podcast is available in audio only. Apologies to all you video/YouTube fans, but we didn’t bring a film crew to Italy.I’m honored to share Gemma’s wisdom, charm and experience with you today. May you be equal parts entertained and enlightened by her welcoming presence.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

June 16, 2019

“If you have a spiritual life, it is for you. It is not something you should inflict on other people.”Russell BrandEvery podcaster has their dream list — guests they fantasize interviewing. From day one, today’s guest has occupied my top slot.Officially, Russell Brand is one of the most recognizable and best-loved comedy performers in the world. He is also is also a phenomenally successful author, broadcaster, actor, columnist, political commentator and mental health & drug rehabilitation activist. His global bestselling books include Revolution*, Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions*, and his latest release, Mentors: How to Help and Be Helped*. Now a devoted dad and husband, when he isn’t touring or performing he can be found hosting Under The Skin on Luminary, one of my very favorite podcasts.Unofficially, Russell is iconic for his very public awakening. A recovering heroin addict, his struggles with drugs, sex, fame, money and power were custom tailored for tabloid fodder. And his satirical but always probing takes on politics, celebrity culture and religion often find him in the crosshairs of controversy.I think of Russell as a hyper-intelligent master of modern discourse and disputation. Perpetually armed with a most delicious turn-of-phrase, he is a philosopher of the extreme. A man who has voyaged to the brink of overindulgence, he has returned to share the unique personal wisdom gleaned from such surfeit with razor-sharp musings on the broader humanity we collectively share — and have a laugh along the path.With a sui generis brew of eccentric wit, subversive candor and extreme charm, Russell grapples fearlessly and out loud with that which lays beneath the surface. With the ideas that define our time. Of the history we are told. And the ulterior truth behind our constructed reality.What is truly real? How can we craft a more fair and just society for all? How can we live a more intentional life of meaning? What does it mean be a spiritual being in a human existence?Today we voyage beyond the walls of our constructed material world. We dive into The Matrix. And to coin Russell’s phrase, lick the walls of the hologram.I’m absolutely delighted by this magical, modern-day mystic.Once a dream, this conversation is now a tangible reality. Or is it?Either way, I sincerely hope you relish the conversation as much as I adored having it.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/russellbrand448 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

111,Cal Newport,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/cal-newport-447/,"Episode 447
June 10, 2019

“Simply put, humans are not wired to be constantly wired.”Cal NewportIt’s become increasingly harder to just put the phone down. Because the latest apps and digital platforms are specifically designed to addict, we have become slaves to their irresistible allure.Our precious attention is being hijacked. The ability to focus — to concentrate on that which is most meaningful — simply cannot compete with the magnetic pull of our Instagram feed. No longer need anyone ever be bored. Alone with one’s thoughts. Or simply present with one’s self. The result is a global epidemic of distraction. A fomenting of loneliness and isolation. And a degradation of our humanity.The solution isn’t Ludditism. Instead it’s agency. We need not be victims of technology. We have the power to liberate ourselves from the tether of digital dependency. And the freedom it creates isn’t just the salve to what ails us, it’s the gateway to that which we seek most. Meaning. True human connection. And a reconnection with our innate humanity.Indeed, there is no substitute for real relationships. Boredom is useful. And focus is the new superpower.Cal Newport is someone who has spent a lot of time thinking deeply about these issues.An associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University, Cal is the author of six books, many of which focus on the impact of technology on society. The primary focus of today’s conversation is rooted in his latest New York Times bestseller, Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World*.Cal’s work has been published in over 20 languages. He is a frequent guest on NPR and has been featured in many major publications, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, New Yorker, Washington Post, and Economist.Regular listeners know I have a penchant for dropping Cal’s name with regularity. I became acquainted with his work in early 2016 by way of his seminal book, Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in A Distracted World* — pages that profoundly impacted how I think about and apply my attention. We struck up an e-mail friendship. And I’ve been trying to track him down for the podcast ever since.People often ask me which books have influenced me the most. The aforementioned two rank close to the top — manifestos of great practical import for our modern age. Similarly, I estimate that this episode rates among the most consequential conversations I’ve had in the 6+ year history of this podcast. Packed with practical, actionable steps, Cal’s message will empower you to free up precious time. Declutter your mind. Connect you more deeply to the work and relationships you care most about. And profoundly improve the quality of your professional and personal lives.It was an absolute pleasure to spend time with Cal. I sincerely hope you not only enjoy the listen, but heed his message, and put his advice into action.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/calnewport447 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

June 6, 2019

“Human existence is but the blink of an eye. It doesn’t take much research to think about how we evolved and why we evolve the way that we do.”Dr. Sanjay GuptaWestern medicine is extraordinary. Over the last several decades, scientific advances in the diagnosis and treatment of previously thought incurable diseases has utterly transformed how we live.But with these breakthroughs comes an arrogance — a hubris that modalities outside the very narrow rubric of our dominant paradigm are without value — archaic, outdated legacies of less developed cultures.But is this always the case? Or do lessons remain to be learned by taking a critical but objective look at how other societies approach health and well-being?This question nagged at Sanjay Gupta, MD. So he decided to find answers for himself.For those unfamiliar, Sanjay is the associate chief of neurosurgery at Atlanta’s Grady Memorial Hospital and assistant professor of neurosurgery at the Emory University School of Medicine. But most people know him as the multiple Emmy-award winning chief medical correspondent for CNN. In his tenure as a journalist he has spent decades covering everything from the 2003 invasion of Iraq to the Haiti earthquake in 2010, where he performed surgery on a 12-year-old girl earthquake victim along with Henri Ford and two U.S. Navy doctors.If that’s not enough, this dad, husband, and novelist was named among “The Sexiest Man Alive” by People magazine and in 2009 was selected for the position of Surgeon General by President Barack Obama — a job he declined.To answer the aforementioned question, Sanjay spent the last year traveling the world, finding where people live longer, happier and more functional lives than anywhere else on the planet. The result of his quest is the recently-aired CNN Original Series Chasing Life — must-see TV if you haven’t caught it already.Today we cover his origin story and incredible career. We discuss the responsibility of journalism in the era of alternative facts — and the role storytelling has played in his personal brand of reporting.We talk about his time in the White House, what it’s like covering overseas conflict zones overseas, and how he manages his work- life balance.In addition, we canvass the current state of health care in America, what he learned about health, happiness and longevity in the course of producing Chasing Life, and the not to be overstated incredible impact Sanjay has had on my own life.Over the years Sanjay has become a good friend, as well as a mentor to me. He is someone I have wanted to get on the show from day one. I love this guy, and I’m delighted to help share his story with you today.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/sanjaygupta446 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“We are, by definition, an ecosystem. The microbiome reveals a more connected biology, radically transforming our approach to medicine, hygiene, diet, and living.”Ara Katz & Raja DhirOur bodies are comprised of about ten trillion cells. But our microbiome — all the bacteria, viruses, and fungi that live in or on our bodies – outnumber human cells by a factor of 10.Indeed, we are far more microorganism than human.Moreover, rapidly developing science reveals the vast extent to which the nature of our personal microbiome drives not only our propensity for disease and digestive health, but also, quite surprisingly, can dictate our mental disposition, cognitive function, and even our specific food cravings.Today we take a magnifying glass to the mind-blowing netherworld of microbiota to illuminate their implications not just on human health, but the well-being of planet Earth at large.Our stewards for this fantastic voyage are Ara Katz and Raja Dhir, the co-founders of Seed, a venture backed microbiome company at the pioneering edge of bacteria science.Ara is a serial entrepreneur and fellow at the MIT Media Lab’s Center for Future Storytelling and CCA’s DesignMBA program. She was named one of the “50 Most Influential Women in America” by Marie Claire, listed on Business Insider’s “Silicon Alley Top 100” and “36 Rockstar Women in NYC Tech”, and was recently included in Create + Cultivate’s 100 List for STEM.One of the most knowledgeable people I have ever met when it comes to our rapidly evolving understanding of the microbiome, Raja is a life sciences entrepreneur and a member of the Microbiome Think Tank at Mass General Hospital. He sits on the editorial board for the scientific journal Microbiome as well as the advisory committee for the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics. In addition, he is a director and co-chair of the scientific advisory board for Micropia, a $20MM microbial ecology and education platform as well as the world’s first museum dedicated to microbes.Today we cover it all.First, we define the microbiome. We discuss the difference between prebiotics and probiotics. And to cut through the consumer confusion fomented by gut health commodification, we separate fact from fiction by examining the difference between an effective priobiotic and the countless food and supplement products simply marketed as such.Most importantly, we explore what the latest science tells us about the power of microbes to heal our bodies, positively impact childhood development, reinvigorate the quality of our soil and improve the overall ecology of Planet Earth — including some amazing work Ara & Raja are doing with bee populations.Seed Offer: As a simple thanks for listening, Ara & Raja have a gift for you at seed.com/richroll.Disclosure: In my opinion, Seed’s Daily Synbiotic it is the highest quality probiotic I have tested (which is one of the reasons I wanted to have them on the show). Rigorously evidence-based, I’ve been using this product for the last several months to great effect. However, I have zero financial involvement with the company. Seed is not a show sponsor. Ara & Raja did not pay me to appear on the podcast. (I have never accepted money for a guest to appear on the show and never will). Nor am I an affiliate of Seed. In other words, I get a big zero from you using the above-mentioned discount code other than the satisfaction of sharing a product I myself enjoy.The work Ara & Raja are doing at Seed is equal parts fascinating and important.

May 26, 2019

“Quitting alcohol isn’t just for alcoholics.”Andy RamageOver the years, I have openly shared my personal journey with alcoholism and that of many guests. A lifeline for the desperate many that struggle in silence, I do this to underscore that there is always hope, no matter how far down you find yourself.But what if you’re not an alcoholic? What if you, like millions of people, occasionally drink just a little too much? Even though it doesn’t destroy your life, it leaves you feeling off. You’re tired of the hangovers, the lethargy and the low grade depression it provokes. You’d prefer to stop. But because drinking is integral to your social or professional life, opting out seems impossible. What then?This week’s guest faced this very predicament, a relatable scenario for a vast number of people. The only difference? Andy Ramage decided to do something about it.A former professional footballer (as they say in the UK), a career-ending injury prompted Andy to hang up the cleats and enter the world of finance. Channeling his work ethic, it didn’t take long for him to become successful in the traditional sense, co-creating two multimillion-dollar city brokerages.But doing well in banking ‘required’ (or so he thought) drinking. Lots of drinking. Long Mad Men style booze-soaked client lunches. Countless happy hours, pub crawls, and cocktail soirées, followed by clubbing and the occasional after party. It’s just what you gotta do to play the game.Andy didn’t necessarily have a drinking ‘problem’. But the lifestyle left him drained. Listless. And looking for a change.Bucking the unwritten rules of his professional environment, he decided to to take a break from alcohol and embarked instead on a quest for peak performance and well-being. It stuck. Not only did Andy feel markedly better, his work performance improved. His relationships became more meaningful. He fell back in love with the simple things that brought him joy as a young lad. Slowly, a new world of life opportunities began to emerge.Transformed, Andy enthusiastically began sharing his experience, challenging friends and colleagues to quit the booze for 28, 90 or even 365-days. What he didn’t know was that the friendly contest he concocted among peers would soon explode into a full-blown international movement he ultimately dubbed One Year No Beer.Today, Andy and his friend Ruari Fairbairns have birthed OYNB into a world-leading behavioral change platform offering instruction and support for a variety of alcohol free challenges. Their companion book, The 28-Day Alcohol-Free Challenge* is a UK bestseller (now available in the U.S.*). To date, their endeavors have inspired over 50,000 people to boot the bottle and invest instead in well-being.I first met Andy two years ago when he turned up for our Plantpower Ireland retreat. Fast friends from the outset, I’ve wanted to share his story ever since.Alcoholism is a self-diagnosed disease. Left untreated, it will progress, ultimately leading you to one of three places: jail, institutions, or death. So if you are a true alcoholic, or a sober member of a certain unnamed 12-step program, Andy’s message isn’t necessarily aimed at you.This one is for the average drinker, those a bit closer to ‘normal’ (whatever that is) on the alcohol spectrum who find themselves abusing the booze from time to time. It’s for those who started drinking in their teens and never really stopped. And it’s for people who have maintained a slow and steady pace of consumption without any given thought to addiction or the negative side effects of alcohol on a daily basis.In other words, this conversation is directed at the majority of our society. Because quitting alcohol isn’t just for alcoholics.OYNB Discount: As a simple thanks for listening, Andy wanted to offer all of you a gift.

May 22, 2019

“Always focus on how far you’ve come, not how far you have to go.” Doug BopstAdmittedly, It’s a thrill to converse with renown experts, world-class athletes and celebrities. But the most rewarding aspect of my job is occasionally turning my spotlight on the everyman — relatable people who have conquered adversity to reinvent themselves wholesale, all in relative civilian anonymity.These people are a gift. Amplifying their stories isn’t just an honor. And it isn’t just my joy. I see it as a responsibility.Through these individuals we are better able to see ourselves. Their weaknesses, struggles and strengths mirror our own. Their relatability uniquely qualifies them to reflect back upon us our shared, collective humanity. In their victories we can connect more viscerally with our own inner power and potential.Today it’s my privilege to share yet another such story. This is the tale of Doug Bopst — an essentially normal kid who, like so many, suffered in silence from depression. To self-medicate he began experimenting with drugs in his teens. Smoking pot quickly evolved into a heavy opioid addiction. A day in the life involved snorting several hundred milligrams of OxyContin, complemented by a pack of cigarettes and the occasional cheesesteak. No exercise. No interest in maintaining relationships with anyone who didn’t do drugs. No self-confidence. And no care for tomorrow.At 21, it all came to a head. High on opiates and on his way to make a drug deal, a cop pulled Doug over for a broken taillight. The officer found $2,000 in cash plus half a pound of marijuana under the spare tire in the trunk. Promptly arrested on a felony drug charge, Doug ultimately served 2 months in jail.It was hardly the harshest sentence. But it was more than sufficient for Doug to hit bottom. Reflect on his errant path. And commit to an entirely new life. A life redeemed by sobriety, faith, fitness and family.I was initially introduced to Doug through my friend Amy Dresner (another sober warrior you may remember from episode 341) and knew immediately I wanted him on the show.In fairness to Doug, his story isn’t entirely that of the anonymous everyman. Now an award-winning personal trainer, author, and public speaker, his saga has been covered by a variety of media outlets, including The Today Show. But the press intrigue is driven by Doug’s innate relatability. And I’m fairly confident this conversation is the most complete chronicle of his life and redemption to date.This is a conversation about what it was like, what happened and what it’s like now. We cover the low lows. Hitting rock bottom. And exactly how he was able to conquer his demons and put the past in the rear view. It’s about the power of sobriety. Leaning on mentors. And how a love of fitness, spirituality, and putting service service first returned him to sanity.All told, it’s a story of redemption full stop — and I’m honored to help tell it.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube at: bit.ly/dougbopst443 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

116,Jesse Thomas,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/jesse-thomas-442/,"Episode 442
May 19, 2019

“There’s just no substitute for working hard.” Jesse ThomasHe’s one of the world’s most popular and accomplished professional triathletes. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this week’s guest — a humble athlete, proud dad, devoted husband and dedicated entrepreneur with a unique success equation: Work hard. Play harder. Love hardest.His name is Jesse Thomas. He’s rad. And this is his story.It begins with a stand out track and field career at Stanford and the Olympic steeplechase dream cut short by a career-ending injury. While later pursuing a masters degree in mechanical engineering, he picked up a bike and progressed so rapidly he entertained a professional cycling career. But that dream too was crushed when a spill left him with a fractured C1 vertebra, nine months in a neck brace, a plate and 4 titanium screws to hold it all together.Life as an athlete was over for Jesse. Or so he thought.Spending the next several years as a tech entrepreneur, Jesse got itchy. He didn’t like being out of shape. So he decided to do something about it.Fast forward to 2011. The stage was Wildflower, a prestigious and formidable half-ironman distance triathlon set in the idyllic rolling hills of central California. A complete unknown amateur, Jesse nonetheless won the race outright, shocking the triathlon community by dominating an impressive professional field on a borrowed bike and a pair of $9 aviator sunglasses he bought at the drug store.The victory was so unexpected, as Jesse crossed the finish line the race announcer had to ask, Who are you?The story is legend. And the rest is history. Jesse went on to become the first person to win that race three years in a row. And along his circuitous path as a professional, he has graced the podium at many of the most lauded triathlons in the world, including 3rd at the coveted Challenge Roth ironman distance event last summer.Jesse’s ability to out-exercise the rest of us is impressive. But it’s only a somewhat unrelatable fraction of what truly interests me about him. It’s who he is that compels me most — a person successfully alchemizing an insanely demanding training and racing schedule against the more relatable pressures of being a present dad, husband, podcast host (check out Work, Play, Love) and CEO of Picky Bars — the performance nutrition company he co-founded with his wife Lauren Fleshman, herself a prolific former professional runner with the most All-American accolades in Stanford athletics history.How does he do it all?Today we canvass a life in motion — from the Wildflower race that changed his life to his symbiotic relationship with entrepreneurship and family that fuels his purpose.We discuss the importance of coaches. Leaning on mentors. The challenges faced by the retiring athlete. And the conundrum of replacing sport with newfound purpose and passion.We explore the career importance of storytelling in the era of social media. Why he decided to start a podcast. And — most importantly — how he turned a cheap pair of aviator shades into a global multi-sport fashion trend.But more than anything, this is a conversation about balancing work, play, and family at the highest level of elite sport. It’s about facing and overcoming obstacles. The mindset required for success. And the work ethic entailed to achieve your dreams.Note: This episode was recorded in early March. At the time, Jesse was preparing to race his first true marathon. However, he subsequently suffered a stress fracture that required surgery. To give you an idea of how Jesse turns setbacks into opportunities, he just swapped the marathon for an unofficial ‘world record’ setting 5K on crutches – 32:43!Picky Bars Offer: As a simple thanks for listening, Jesse wanted to offer all of you a gift.

“Awareness is peace.” Pete HolmesComedian! Writer! Author! Spiritual seeker!One of my favorite people, Pete Holmes needs no introduction. But I’m going to give it to you anyway.A stand up veteran with a cornucopia of comedy specials, television shows and late night appearances to his name, Pete is best known as the creator and star of the semi-autobiographical HBO show Crashing, a riotous and touching series he executive produced alongside Judd Apatow loosely based on Pete’s life in the early days of his comedy career.In addition, Pete hosts You Made It Weird — hands down one of my absolute favorite podcasts (I was honored to be a guest) — and is the author of the brilliant and just released Comedy Sex God*. Part autobiography, part philosophical inquiry, part sacred quest, I can’t recommend this book more highly. Equally hilarious and profound, it hits bookstores everywhere this week. Pick it up immediately*. Read. Ponder. Thank me later.A long-time fan of Pete’s, we were first introduced by our mutual friend (and former podcast guest) Rob Bell. From that moment forward I have yearned to get this fellow traveler on the show. It finally happened. And the experience is everything I hoped it would be.Comedy. Sex. God. And everything in between. We cover it all.We discuss his evangelical upbringing and how his failed attempt to live up to picture perfect standards forced him to question his faith and re-examine long-held beliefs, catalyzing the soul-seeking journey he has pursued ever since.We talk comedy and creativity. How he squares Christianity with alternative faith modalities. And what he has learned spending time with spiritual savants like Ram Dass and experimenting with psychedelics.We explore how fatherhood has impacted his spiritual and professional perspective. What it’s like working with Judd Apatow. The experience of being a celebrity with a big show on HBO. And, more importantly, what happens when that show suddenly goes away.But mostly, this is a beautiful exploration of the messy, confusing, wonderful, mysterious, disorienting thing we call life.You can watch the entire conversation on YouTube at bit.ly/peteholmes441 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.As Pete would say, GET INTO IT!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

May 9, 2019

“Guilt is about what you’ve done. Shame is about who you are.” Jeff GrantAn epidemic of colossal proportions, millions struggle with substance addiction. Suffering in silence, they too often slip through the cracks, desperate and alone.As a society, it’s incumbent upon us to better address the problem. Improve our collective understanding of its underlying causes. And enhance access to the resources required to heal the decaying hungry ghosts among us.It is for these reasons I felt compelled to share the story of Rev. Jeff Grant — a former well-respected New York City attorney who got hooked on painkillers and started making decisions so bad, he lost everything.Like so many, Jeff’s using started rather innocently in the aftermath of a basketball injury. But it didn’t take long before the tectonic plates of his ethical landscape began to shift. Under the influence, he perpetrated a series of financial misdeeds that led to losing control of his law firm. A suicide attempt prompted sobriety, but the long shadow cast by past actions revisited Jeff with a felony fraud conviction and a federal prison sentence.After serving 18 months, Jeff was faced with re-entry. His old life was no longer an option. He had to create an entirely new one.Searching for a meaningful spiritual life line to help make sense of his transgressions and inform his trajectory moving forward, Jeff entered the Seminary, earning a Master of Divinity from Union Theological Seminary in New York, with a focus in Christian Social Ethics.Upon graduation, he began serving at an inner-city church in Bridgeport, Connecticut as Associate Minister and Director of Prison Ministries. It is here that Jeff finds his calling assisting convicted felons and their families to navigate the treacherous waters of civilian re-entry.Now an ordained minister with 16+ years of continuous sobriety,  Jeff is the co-founder of Progressive Prison Ministries, the world’s first ministry created to provide confidential support to individuals, families and organizations with white collar incarceration issues. He has been profiled in a variety of media outlets including Inc., Forbes and Business Insider, has graced the stage at The Nantucket Project (where we first met) and hosts the Criminal Justice Insider Podcast.This is his story.It’s a conversation about the perils of addiction and the joys of sobriety. It’s about the the opioid epidemic and the prison industrial complex it supports. And it’s about how spirituality and divinity can pave the road to redemption.Not just a cautionary tale from the perspective of a white collar felon, this is also discussion about what happens to the by-standing family members and loved ones, often overlooked casualties in the perpetrator’s wake.
But ultimately this is a story about absolution. It’s about confronting past misdeeds. Making amends. Finding grace. And giving back to those in need by sharing the experience and wisdom procured along the way.For the visually inclined, you can watch our entire conversation on YouTube at bit.ly/jeffgrant440 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“We all have reservoirs of untapped potential. The biggest thing standing in our way? Our minds.”Colin O’BradyLife has taught me one essential truth: the human spirit is boundless.Just when you think we’ve reached the absolute pinnacle of what’s physically possible, someone performs a feat so utterly mind-bending you’re left breathless. The skies of perception part. Blanketed in awe, we’re compelled to re-evaluate our own personal capabilities. And humanity is left just a little bit better than it was before.This is the sensation I experience when I spend time with Colin O’Brady — a former Yale swimmer turned professional triathlete turned elite adventure athlete with 4 breathtaking world records to his name.Colin’s latest jaw-dropping feat of athletic prowess, stunning endurance and sheer human will was becoming the first person in history to cross the continent of Antarctica solo, unsupported and unaided. Under nothing but his own power, Colin pulled a 300lb sled 932 miles in just 54 days across the coldest, windiest, most remote continent on earth from the Atlantic to the Pacific via the South Pole.Colin first appeared on the podcast in December of 2015 (RRP 207) — a deep dive into his unique upbringing on a commune; how he survived an almost lethal burn accident that left him unlikely to walk again; his phoenix like transformation into a professional ITU triathlete and Olympic hopeful; and how he morphed into a mountaineer with the audacity to attempt incomprehensible feats of adventure athleticism.After conquering the Explorer’s Grand Slam, a challenge that encompassed scaling the highest mountain on each of the seven continents and treks to both the North and South Poles, Colin returned to the podcast in June of 2016 (RRP 235). Among the 44 who have completed the EGS, only 2 have done it under a year. Not only was Colin the youngest person to successfully complete this most prestigious undertaking, he crushed the world record by a stunning 53-day margin, completing it in a mere 139 days. Along the way, he simultaneously broke the 7 Summits world record by two days.Today he returns to share his most remarkable achievement to date, a freeze solo adventure he dubbed the Impossible First. It’s a jaw-dropping story you might have seen unfold in real time on Colin’s Instagram (@colinobrady) or in the stellar 360-degree New York Times coverage penned by my friend (and former podcast guest) Adam Skolnick.Uncovering the why behind the expedition, we explore how he dealt with the gear, solitude, -80F temps, and 30 mph headwinds. He explains why to sweat is to die. We discuss his battle against the elements and British Army Captain Louis Rudd — the legendary explorer who also set off the same day with the same goal in his heart. We talk about Colin’s final day 77-mile, 32-hour superhuman push to the finish. And Colin explains how a phone call with a certain musician changed his entire perception on who he is.But mostly this is about a man who uses endurance and adventure as art that speaks to the heart and soul of the human experience.The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube at bit.ly/colinobrady439 (please subscribe!) and as always the podcast is available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.I sincerely hope you enjoy this extraordinary tale of an extraordinary human — an inspiration to millions and someone I’m proud to call friend.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

120,Lisa Damour,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/lisa-damour-438/,"Episode 438
April 29, 2019

“We run the risk now of raising a generation that is stressed about being stressed, and anxious about being anxious.”Lisa Damour, PhDToday’s expedition takes us into the beautifully mysterious world of parenting, with a specific lens on navigating the perplexing vicissitudes of the teenage girl — one of the most beguiling and opaque creatures I’ve encountered in my 52 years.I have been a parent and step-parent for two decades. Along the way, I successfully helped raise two young boys. Sure, I made many mistakes. But I also did a few things right. Today they are both amazing young men. And yet somehow that experience failed to adequately prepare me for the rather unique challenges I face guiding a teenage daughter towards adulthood — a joy that has at times brought me to my knees.To elevate my parenting game, I began searching for greater insight into the idiosyncratic psyche of the female adolescent. That quest continuously referred me to one notable expert: Lisa Damour, PhD.A teen whisperer par excellence, Lisa is a Yale educated psychotherapist with a doctorate in Clinical Psychology from the University of Michigan who specializes in education and child development. But she is best known for her two New York Times bestselling books — Untangled: Guiding Teenage Girls Through the Seven Transitions into Adulthood*; and her newest release, Under Pressure: Confronting the Epidemic of Stress and Anxiety in Girls*.The parent of two teenage girls herself, Lisa writes the monthly Adolescence column for the New York Times. In addition to her private consulting and psychotherapy practice, she is a regular contributor to CBS News, speaks internationally, is a Senior Advisor to the Schubert Center for Child Studies at Case Western Reserve University, and serves as the Executive Director of Laurel School’s Center for Research on Girls.This is all a long way of saying that when it comes to adolescents and teens, Lisa knows her shit.Today’s conversation deconstructs the particular emotional overload and unique social pressures young people face – everything from sex and drugs to body image, grades, navigating social media and everything in between. By better understanding the nature of these dynamics, and how they specifically impact our young ones, we glean insight into how to optimally parent through them.In addition, we discuss the recent astronomical rise in stress and anxiety in young girls — what accounts for it, and what it means.We also cover the common mistakes many parents (myself included) often make. We delve deep into the importance of open communication and how to foster it.Finally, Lisa imparts a myriad of strategies to optimally pilot the healthy developmental transitions that specifically girls (but also boys) undergo as they mature into grownups so that we, as parents, can help cultivate self-esteem and self-efficacy in the next generation under our charge.If you are a parent of young humans trying to make the right moves — or just want to better understand how young people think and why they behave as they do — then this episode is appointment listening.Lisa’s books have been instrumental in improving how I parent my daughters, so this is a meeting of great personal significance I have been hotly awaiting for some time.They don’t call her the teen whisperer for nothing. Lisa gets girls. And today, she nails it.For the visually inclined, you can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/lisadamour438 (please subscribe!) and the podcast is of course available on Apple Podcasts and available on Spotify.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

121,Coach's Corner,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/coachs-corner-437/,"Episode 437
April 25, 2019

“You are never going to be the same person you were yesterday because there’s always something you learned in that workout about yourself, your fitness, your mind, and your nutrition. That’s the training process.” Chris HauthMaking his latest appearance in our ongoing Coach’s Corner series is none other than Chris Hauth, one of the world’s most respected endurance and ultra-endurance coaches.A sub-9 hour Ironman, Chris (@AIMPCoach) is a former professional triathlete, Age Group Ironman World Champion, and 2-time Olympic Swimmer. In 2006, Chris won the Ironman Coeur D’Alene and went on to be the first American amateur & 4th overall American at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii.When he’s not training and racing, Chris hosts the Weekly Word Podcast and runs AIMP Coaching, mentoring a wide spectrum of athletes ranging from elite professionals — including Ironman and Western States top finishers, Ultraman winners and Olympic Trials qualifiers — to first time half-marathoners.Whether you are an elite athlete or just starting out, Chris knows how to get the best out of athletes the right way. A long-time friend and mentor as much as a coach, I have been under Chris’ tutelage since 2008, during which time he deftly guided me through three Ultraman World Championships (’08, ’09 & ’11), EPIC5 in 2010 and the Ötillö Swimrun World Championships in 2017, an event we raced together as a team.I could have never achieved the level of athletic success I have enjoyed without Chris’ deft counsel, so it is with pleasure that I share more of his wisdom with you today.As we put the cold winter months behind us, today’s conversation focuses on balancing your fitness goals against life’s demands as we welcome warmer days. As always, Chris drops knowledge applicable whether you are a professional athlete or a cubicle warrior just looking to improve the quality of your day to day. Specific topics discussed include:DK Goals! In addition, my man ‘DK’ David Kahn joins me for the introduction to talk 2019 goals. Give him a boost at @daviddarrenkahn on twitter with the tags #DKGoals and #DK190.Final Note: As you will hear early in the episode, I had originally anticipated releasing this episode in mid-March. Due to scheduling it got pushed to late April. So please disregard the audible references to March. Nonetheless, the wisdom is timeless.For those in the northern hemisphere, Spring is officially here. Whether you’ve fallen off track or been on top of your game, it’s the perfect time to once again check-in with the coach.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange. If you’re new to the show, please check out Chris’ previous RRP appearances in episodes 21, 256, 297, 309, 313, 329, 377 and 415.For the visually inclined, you can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/chrishauth437 and the podcast is now available on Spotify.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

122,David Sinclair PhD,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/david-sinclair-436/,"Episode 436
April 23, 2019

“Nothing matters except making the world a better place after you’ve been here.”David Sinclair, PhDEverybody grows old. Everyone dies.But is this scientific fact? Or is it merely a story based on history and our current understanding of biology?What if we instead consider aging as a disease? This begs the question: what is the cure?Welcome to the mind of David Sinclair, PhD, one of the world’s leading scientific authorities on longevity, aging and how to slow its effects.A professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-Director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging, David obtained his Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics at the University of New South Wales, Sydney in 1995 and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at M.I.T. where, among other things, he co-discovered the cause of aging for yeast.The co-founder of several biotechnology companies, David is also co-founder and co-chief editor of the journal Aging. His work has been featured in a variety of books, documentaries, and media, including 60 Minutes, Nightline and NOVA. He is an inventor on 35 patents, has been lauded as one of the Top 100 Australian Innovators, and made TIME magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world.In addition, David is the author of the forthcoming book, Lifespan: The Revolutionary Science of Why We Age — and Why We Don’t Have To* which hits bookstores on Sept. 10 and is currently available for pre-order here*.This is an absolutely fascinating conversation on all things human lifespan, aging and longevity. We begin with the specific scientific mechanisms that contribute to biological degeneration. Then we dive deep into the hard science David and his peers are examining to better understand what contributes to aging and how to prevent it.According to David, the prospect of living to 200+ is not a pipe dream, but a very possible reality. If humans could indeed double lifespan, how would this change how you live? And what does this mean for the future of humanity?This conversation travels deep into the scientific weeds. Perfect for the geeks among us. But it’s also grounded in practical takeaways for all of us — because David’s work isn’t just about extending lifespan. It’s about learning how to live as vibrantly and energetically as possible for as long as possible.It’s an honor and a privilege to share this brilliant man’s pioneering work and wisdom with you today. Plus he’s a lovely guy. If you enjoyed my episode with Dr. Valter Longo (RRP #367), a fellow brilliant warrior in the longevity space, then I’m fairly confident you’re going to love this one. So break out that pen and paper, because you’re going to want to take notes on this one.I sincerely hope you enjoy the episode.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

123,Mark Gainey and Michael Horvath,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/mark-gainey-and-michael-horvath-435/,"Episode 435
April 16, 2019

“If you sweat, you’re an athlete. It’s as simple as that.”Mark Gainey & Michael HorvathRiding up a local canyon climb back in what must have been late 2009, my Airstream-dwelling, frequent cycling compadre Stu Bone couldn’t stop talking about this brand new social network specifically aimed at the 2-wheel community.Always eager to test new tech, I signed up immediately, quickly fell in love and have been evangelizing the platform every since.Meet Strava — the fitness social network designed by athletes for athletes.Evolving beyond it’s cycling roots as a platform for all who sweat, today Strava is widely embraced as the premier workout sharing fitness network — a rapidly expanding ecosystem of Olympic, professional, elite, amateur and beginner athletes that boasts over 1 million new registered new users every month and growing.What distinguishes Strava from other fitness trackers and social media platforms is the positive emotional connection it engenders. Encouraging and community oriented, it’s devoid of the negativity and toxicity that plagues most sharing networks. There’s something uniquely special about being privy to the daily grind of my favorite multi-sport athletes. Their transparency holds me accountable. In turn I help hold my community accountable. And openly sharing our collective fitness experience – the highs and the lows — makes all of us better.So just how did Strava become the only fitness app that matters?To get the story behind the story, today I sit down with Mark Gainey and Michael Horvath — the dynamic duo co-founders who gave birth to Strava and continue to guide it’s ongoing growth and evolution.Currently Strava’s interim CFO, Michael Horvath previously served as Chief Executive Officer from 2010-2013 and President from 2014-2017. Holding a Ph.D. in economics from Northwestern University and an A.B. in economics from Harvard (where he was men’s lightweight crew team captain), Michael is a former Stanford economics professor and entrepreneurship professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. Prior to Strava, Michael co-founded enterprise software firm Kana Communications and was the CFO and VP of Operations at GlycoFi, a biotech company.Mark Gainey currently serves as the co-founder and chairman of Strava. Also a Harvard graduate, Mark is a former venture capital executive and seasoned entrepreneur who has been building successful companies for nearly 20 years, including Kana, which he co-founded alongside Michael as CEO, president, and chairman. In addition, Mark sits on the board of Alter-G, BoardVantage, Daum, Clari, and Coaching Corps.Michael and Mark initially met on the crew team at Harvard. Friendship ensued, but after graduation they pursued disparate paths. Mark went into venture capital in Palo Alto. Michael became an academic. Reunited when Michael took a professorship at Stanford, they hatched their first startup. Kana Communications was a massive triumph. Little did they know that their follow up act — a passion project born out of a mutual love for fitness — would eclipse their first company’s success, reshaping the fitness landscape for millions of athletes across the world.This exchange canvasses everything from technology, business and entrepreneurship to fitness, sports and social media.But at it’s core, it’s a conversation about community. How to create it. How to nurture it. And why the integrity of community is paramount.I love Strava. As an early adopter (I was the 14,443 person to sign up for the service), it’s my pleasure to share Mark and Michael’s story with you today.Disclosure: In the interest of total transparency, I have run ad campaigns for Strava on this podcast in the past. Obviously this show was compensated for those ads. And I’d be happy to do reads for Strava in the future. However, this is not a sponsored podcast. I am not being compensated in any way for hosting Mark and Michael on the show. Nor am I paid to use Strava. I am simply a fan of the platform. Mark and Michael are two people I have always wanted to meet. Their story is as interesting as it is instructive. So when the opportunity to host them arose, I jumped on it. Nothing more, nothing less.Qatar Quest: Two years ago I decided to share my training preparation for the Ötillö Swimrun World Championships. To hold myself accountable and transparent, I posted every single workout on Strava (follow me here) and Instagram Stories. It was super fun. So I’m doing it again. In November I will be participating in the Qatar Quest — a reverse order ultra-distance triathlon that will circumnavigate the Qatar peninsula. I began formal preparation two weeks ago and have been posting all my workouts on Strava, accompanied by regular Instagram Stories and the occasional vlog on YouTube.I sincerely hope you enjoy the episode.

“Sometimes what appears to be negative is the most positive thing you can do. What appears to be ‘safe’ is sometimes the most dangerous thing you can be doing for your life”Guru SinghWelcome to yet another edition Guru Corner featuring Guru Singh, my favorite teacher on all things mystic and metaphysical.Fusing Eastern mysticism with Western pragmatism, Guru Singh is a celebrated third-generation Sikh yogi and master spiritual teacher who has been studying and teaching Kundalini Yoga for more than 40 years. He is the author of several books, a powerful lecturer and behind-the-scenes guide to many a luminary, including Fortune 500 CEOs, athletes, and artists.A peer of rock legends like Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead, Guru Singh is also an accomplished musician who began his recording career on Warner Bros’ Reprise label in the 1960’s. When he isn’t laying down tracks with people like Seal, he’s bringing down the house on the daily at Yoga West, his Los Angeles home base.Today we spin the wheel on positivity. Not your typical disquisition on the benefits of adopting a positive mental attitude, we take a more nuanced approach to self-awareness. Focusing on receptivity over repression, it’s a call to embrace the power of both negativity and positivity as important forces to be experienced without getting lost in either extreme. And we discuss how to break free from the entrenched, looping stories we tell ourselves about ourselves that don’t serve the lives we aspire to lead.Note: If you missed my previous conversations with Guru Singh, start with episode 267 and then enjoy episodes 332, 368, 393, 400 and 418.Final Note: You can watch our conversation on YouTube at bit.ly/gurucorner434b and the show is also now available on Spotify.I love this beautiful being.

April 8, 2019

“Don’t identify as an artist, be the art.“Kevin SmithAbout 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year. In other words, America’s number one killer claims 1 out of every 4 deaths.Not all heart attacks are fatal. But when your heart’s left anterior descending artery becomes 100% blocked, the result is a massive heart attack known as The Widowmaker.Few survive its fatal clutch.Kevin Smith is the rare exception that proves the rule.The arch villain in his own personal superhero comic book narrative, Kevin’s Widowmaker nemesis failed in it’s dastardly quest to claim his young life. Instead, like Spiderman in the aftermath of that fateful bite, it made our protagonist hero stronger — more convicted about his life, purpose, family and art.One might even say it gave him superpowers — a new life animated by an urgent productivity. An emboldened creativity. And, more than anything, a spirit ennobled.This week’s guest beat the odds. But this should come as no surprise for those well versed in the Kevin Smith canon. Because Kevin has always been an outlier — a fiercely independent voice who has been successfully cutting against the grain for as long as he can remember.Today this charismatic master storyteller shares his most amazing tale to date — the story of Kevin Smith.For the few unfamiliar among us, Kevin is a filmmaker, actor, comedian, comic book writer, author and early podcast pioneer. In 1994 he burst into prominence with his hyper low-budget comedy Clerks, a film he wrote, directed, co-produced, and filmed in the convenience store where he worked. Premiering at Sundance, it was feted with the festival’s highest award before going on to become an indie cult classic.In addition to countless appearances in both movies and television, Kevin has created a litany of films, including Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Cop Out, Jersey Girl, Red State, Tusk, Yoga Hosers and Clerks 2. Just last week he wrapped production on Jay and Silent Bob Reboot.An iconic and beloved character amongst indie film fans and comic book nerds, Kevin is immediately recognizable and famous for his hockey jerseys, backwards hat and well, his weight.  But in February of 2018, between sets of one his stand-up shows, Kevin suffered his aforementioned heart attack.A lifestyle change was needed. Desperately.Harley Quinn Smith (a vegan herself) suggested Kevin adopt a plant-based diet. Kevin obliged. For the first time in ages, he began exercising. In short shrift, he lost 50 pounds. His blood work normalized. And the rest is history.Today we unpack all of it. How maxing out his credit cards spawned an entire career. His perspective on podcasting as one of the very first to embrace the medium. And of course the amazing transformation that compelled me to seek him out.Heart disease is ubiquitous. But as Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn is so fond of saying, it’s a toothless paper tiger that need not exist. So if you feel stuck in lifestyle habits that are leading to your own fateful confrontation with that villainous Widowmaker, my greatest hope is that this conversation catalyzes the required changes well within your grasp to master — because inside all of us is a latent superhero waiting to unleash its fury on the unnecessary evil that is heart disease.As a long time fan of Kevin, it was an absolute delight and honor to spend a few hours with him. I love everything about this exchange. I hope you do too.Final note: I conducted this interview at Kevin’s house, so no video version of this episode.

April 2, 2019

“We’re systematically destroying the life in soil and bringing our crops to harvest with more and more chemical inputs and treating soil like dead dirt instead of the life-giving resource that it is.“David BronnerEat local. Buy organic. Avoid GMO. Give back. Be of service. These are all great practices. Good for your health. Good for humanity. And good for the planet.But it’s not enough.The health and environmental problems we currently face are global epidemics of unprecedented scope and scale.We simply cannot solve these issues with the mindset that created them.What we need, now more than ever, is a revolution of consciousness.There are few people more well suited for this conversation than David Bronner. By far the most unique ‘CEO’ I have ever met, this week’s guest is the Cosmic Engagement Officer of Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soaps, the top-selling brand of natural soaps in North America and producer of a range of organic body care and food products. The Dr. Bronner story, which is amazing, begins in 1948 with Emanuel Bronner — a German immigrant, third-generation master soapmaker, master consciousness and generally far out dude — who used his ecological soaps to proselytize his “All One” philosophy, labeling product bottles with the key tenets of his teachings on self-realization and unity across religious and ethnic divides. Embraced by 1960’s counterculture for its ecological properties and spiritual sensibility, the brand soon found it’s way into most natural foods markets across the United States.David and his brother Michael eventually took stewardship of the family business, shepherding their grandfather’s brand from counterculture cult status to mainstream embrace by growing revenues from $4 million in 1998 to over $111 million in 2017.Along the way, David went to great lengths to respect, protect and ultimately deepen Emanuel’s vision, cultivating a thriving and truly conscious capitalistic enterprise making socially & environmentally responsible products while successfully pursuing its broader mission to create a better world for ourselves and future generations.Environmental activist. Psychonaut. Visionary.These are but a few of the words that describe David, a man who very much shares his grandfather’s ‘cosmic hippie’ DNA but matches it with entrepreneurial flair, a degree from Harvard and the business savvy necessary to grow and sustain an ongoing concern at scale.Under David’s stewardship, Dr. Bronner’s has championed a number of causes, many of which provide the foundation for today’s conversation — a free range exchange that explores David’s involvement in advancing animal rights, drug policy reform, GMO regulation, regenerative organic agricultural practices, fair trade projects and practices, medicinal applications for cannabis and psychedelics, as well as wage equality, including self-imposed caps on executive pay.Backing up its mission statement, roughly a third of Dr. Bronner’s profits are dedicated to charitable giving and activist causes annually. Furthermore, the company is a founding partner in the Climate Collaborative, which leverages the power of the Natural Products Industry to compel action on climate change.This is David’s story. And it’s sure to blow your mind.Disclaimer #1: David expounds upon his personal experience with with psychedelics and cannabis in the context of spiritual growth. As someone who has been in recovery for substance abuse for the last twenty years, I am not endorsing his methods. His experience is his own. Take to heart only what resonates with you.Disclaimer #2: This is not a branded podcast. I have no financial relationship with Dr. Bronner’s and was not paid to host David (to be clear, I have never accepted money to host a guest, and never will). I am simply a fan of the Dr. Bronner ethos and products, have followed David’s journey with admiration for some time and have always wanted to have this conversation.For those visually inclined, you can watch our conversation on YouTube at: bit.ly/davidbronner432 or listen in on Apple Podcasts or Spotify.And finally, check out Journey to Pavitramenthe, an amazing just released 8-minute documentary produced by David’s team that tells the story of the farming communities in Bareilly, India that supply the organic mint oil used in Dr. Bronner’s iconic peppermint soap. It beautifully embodies all the themes discussed today.I love this conversation.

“I really try not to pay attention as much as I can to the reaction to the art. For me the reward is in the making of the art in the first place.“Mike Posner An accomplished singer, songwriter, poet & producer, Mike Posner knows what it’s like to be rich and famous.He also knows what it’s like to be forgotten. To grieve. To grow. To embrace that which is most important. And ultimately express his truth through art.This is the story of a remarkable talent’s attempt to live an artist’s life — the struggles faced and lessons learned along his most mercurial path.In 2010, while still an undergraduate at Duke, the Detroit native’s career exploded with the release of his debut song Cooler Than Me. The irresistible pop song topped charts worldwide, selling more than two million copies and launching him into the stratosphere almost overnight.But fame is fleeting. Unable to immediately top his debut, Mike’s solo career soon faltered. Turning to writing, Mike spent the next several years behind the curtain churning out hit songs for everyone from Justin Bieber (‘Boyfriend’) and Maroon 5 (‘Sugar’) to Pharrell, Snoop Dogg, Nick Jonas and Avicii.Then, in 2016, his career as a solo artist once again blossomed. A remix of his song ‘I Took A Pill In Ibiza’ unexpectedly surfaced as an international smash on the electronic dance scene, landing him a Grammy nomination for Best Song that year.Not long after, Mike was hit with a trifecta of heartache. He weathered a break up with his girlfriend. His father passed after a bout with brain cancer. And his friend and frequent collaborator Avicii took his own life. It was a dark time for the young musician. But the life of an artist is one of persistence. No matter what, Mike continued to show up for music.The result, and his best work to date, is the recently released album, A Real Good Kid — a mature, vulnerable and infectious pop meditation on grief, celebrity, ego, loss, art and personal growth.Without a doubt, Mike is an incredibly talented musician. But what inspired this conversation has little to do with music and everything to do with character.What draws me to this human is his spirit. An old soul with an expansive perspective on art, life and meaning that belies his age, Mike overflows with emotional wisdom forged from experience. And his unbridled, authentic enthusiasm for life and personal expression is as infectious as it is instructive.This is the story of unpredictable highs. Low lows. Love and loss. What it means to move on. And finding solace while stuck in the middle.I first saw Mike perform before an IN-Q spoken word event several years ago and ever since have appreciated him from afar. But I fell in love with him during our conversation. I’m fairly certain you will too.For those visually inclined, you can watch our conversation on YouTube at: bit.ly/mikeposner431 or listen in on Apple Podcasts or Spotify.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

128,Jack Dorsey,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/jack-dorsey-430/,"Episode 430
March 21, 2019

“There’s no path towards evolution and making something better unless we can talk about it.“Jack Dorsey Imagine shouldering responsibility of one of the planet’s largest social networks. Now imagine that’s just one of your jobs, the second focused on reinventing the world’s relationship with money.This is Jack Dorsey’s life.The co-founder and CEO of both Twitter and Square, today’s guest is one of the most influential figures of the modern age — a man who has made an indelible impact on our cultural landscape by quite literally shaping how society communicates in the emergent digital era.What started as a simple means to share personal status updates, Twitter has swelled into arguably the most important social media platform for breaking news, journalism, and political discourse. A powerful tool for speaking truth to power, it’s put wind in the sails of important social movements. Provided safe haven for whistle blowers. And given marginalized groups and dissidents a voice that can be heard across the globe.But Twitter must also account for the noxious devolution of civil discourse —  a behemoth apparatus easily weaponized for motives nefarious.Twitter is nothing if not controversial. And Jack is the face of such controversy — a polarizing figure in the crosshairs of Twitter critics across all sides of the social and political spectrum.Recognizing the need to more thoroughly address Twitter’s role and responsibility in the growing toxicity of public conversation, Jack has spent the last month publicly addressing the platform’s missteps, challenges and aspirations on a wide variety of media platforms and podcasts that include two appearances on The Joe Rogan Experience, Sam Harris’ podcast Making Sense, and many others.My sense is that critics were left unsatisfied with Jack’s answers to the many hard questions posed.I understand and appreciate the criticism. Just how exactly can Twitter successfully promote healthy conversation, eliminate toxicity and fairly police bad actors across 500 million daily tweets? I don’t know the answer. But I do know that I heard an intelligent, empathetic and well intentioned man in an almost impossible situation — someone owning his failures and transparently endeavoring with great equanimity to solve these herculean problems in both good faith and real time.In approaching this conversation, I made the choice not to retread territory explored at great length on Rogan. Instead, my interest is to better understand the human behind the curtain.What does it actually feel like to be at the helm of one of the largest and most powerful social media platforms in the world? What is a day in the life of Jack Dorsey like? What daily self-care practices does he employ to mitigate the stress of his gargantuan responsibilities? And just how did this young man blaze such an extraordinary entrepreneurial path?I first met Jack about two years ago during a visit to San Francisco. A fan of the podcast, he invited me up to the Square offices. Although our encounter was brief, I liked him immediately. Soft spoken, kind and curious, I left our meeting wanting to better understand what makes him tick.Open to sharing his story on the podcast, I visited his San Francisco home on a foggy Saturday morning a few weeks ago. Unsurprisingly, his home is beautiful and well appointed. But it’s also strikingly modest given his stature. Minimal to the point of spartan, it’s devoid of material excess. No entourage. No private chef. No crazy car collection. Not even an assistant. Just Jack, barefoot, unpretentious and excited to show me his infrared sauna, his cold plunge, and the kitchen counter where he works from home two days a week.Struck by the serenity of Jack’s environment, it was immediately clear that this is a man who has mindfully excised unnecessary distraction from his life — an introvert who prioritizes solitude to perform the deep thinking required to shepherd, to the best of his ability, two of the largest and most successful technology companies in the world.This conversation is an exploration of that interior life.Of course, we canvass all things Twitter, including the responsibilities, logistics and challenges posed in shaping, policing and reforming the platform’s 260+ million users. We discuss the importance of civil discourse and his aspirations for Twitter’s role in promoting healthier public conversation. And we close with Jack’s take on disrupting and innovating the podcast space (hint: blockchain is involved).But mostly this is my attempt to understand Jack and the habits, practices and strategies he employs — including Vipassana meditation and intermittent fasting — to navigate his most uncommon life as one of the most influential figures of our time.Serendipitously, Twitter just happened to turn 13 years old today. To celebrate, here’s my very first tweet, dated August 4, 2008:My afternoon with Jack left me changed, thinking more deeply about the mindfulness and intentionality I bring to my daily life. My hope is that this conversation leaves you similarly impacted.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

March 19, 2019

“There is both good passion and bad passion. And what direction your passion takes is largely up to you.”Brad Stulberg & Steve Magness   Follow your passion.For many it’s a mantra. For others, an over-hyped trope.I plead guilty to advocating this pursuit — a subject worthy of frequent exploration on the podcast.But is a life propelled by passion always the best course of action?The answer, it turns out, is complicated.Passion can be a gift. But only if you know how to properly channel it. The same drive that fuels breakthroughs — whether they’re athletic, scientific, entrepreneurial, or artistic — can be every bit as destructive as it is productive. Unchecked by balance (that other culturally touted virtue), passion can manifest as a curse, leading to endless seeking, suffering, and burnout.Simply put, passion is a paradox.To demystify this important subject, my friends Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness return to the podcast (their 1st appearance was RRP 293 back in June 2017) to explore how to develop, harness and express the right kind of passion to unlock potential and actualize a meaningful, purpose-driven life.Long time listeners might recall Steve as a former elite track & field athlete who clocked an extraordinary 4:01 mile in high school. Today, Steve is one of the most accomplished, respected and in demand track & field and cross country coaches in the world. In addition to serving up duties at the University of Houston, he is the personal coach to some of the most accomplished professional and Olympic runners on the planet. In addition, he consults with start-up technology companies on innovation and growth, holds a Master’s degree in Exercise Science from George Mason University, and serves as an adjunct professor at St. Mary’s University in the United Kingdom.Brad is a former McKinsey & Co. health care consultant turned writer specializing in the health and science of human performance. Lauded for his ability to merge the latest science with compelling personal stories and practical insights, his work has been published in The New York Times, Outside Magazine, New York Magazine, Forbes, NPR, The Los Angeles Times & Runner’s World.Together, Steve and Brad are the co-authors of Peak Performance: Elevate Your Game, Avoid Burnout, and Thrive with the New Science of Success*, a science-based primer on the principles that drive and sustain high performance in sport, business and life.This week marks the publication of their latest collaboration, aptly titled The Passion Paradox: A Guide to Going All In, Finding Success, and Discovering the Benefits of an Unbalanced Life*. A fascinating look int0 the science behind passion and it’s double-edge-sword nature, it’s a must read for anyone searching for that spark or how to best harness its magical powers to unlock inner potential.Today’s conversation is a wide-ranging exploration into the very nature of passion. Chock-a-block with scientific takeaways & experiential insights, we examine the pros and cons of this intoxicating impulse. We mine how one finds and cultivates the kind of passion that lets you achieve great things without ruining your life. How passion unchecked can devolve into unhealthy obsession. The best route to avoid this and other dangerous downsides. And the biological and psychological factors that give rise to and ultimately sustain passion’s magical powers.Click here to watch our conversation on YouTube or listen on Apple Podcasts or Spotify.Special Offer:  If you’re looking to dial up your nutrition, right now you can get $20 off the annual membership fee to The Plantpower Meal Planner when you use the code POWER 20 at checkout.

130,Nadia Bolz-Weber,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/nadia-bolz-weber-428/,"Episode 428
March 11, 2019

 “God, please help me not be an asshole, is about as common a prayer as I pray in my life.“Nadia Bolz-WeberToday we continue my exploration of faith with one of the most fascinating spiritual leaders in America today — a Lutheran pastor and public theologian dedicated to redefining how we think about church, practice religion, ritualize divinity, and cultivate community.But her latest concentration, and the focus of today’s conversation, is reforming religion’s antiquated, sexist ideas about sex, gender and our bodies – and all the pain, guilt and shame they provoke — to reclaim our sexuality and boldly begin anew.You see, Nadia Bolz-Weber is no ordinary pastor.Standing six-foot-one, this heavily tattooed former drug addict rocks the collar with bright red lipstick, fancies serious custom-made jewelry (her rings and belt buckles are off the hook) and swears like a sailor. Confusing matters more, she’s also very much a traditionalist – a fearless and deeply reverent pastor for America’s outsiders with intrepid beliefs about what “church” can and should be for the seekers among us.For eleven years, Nadia served as the founding pastor of House for All Sinners and Saints, a colorful and eclectic, all-comers welcome congregation she started in 2007 with just eight members in her living room in Denver.She is also a three-time New York Times bestselling author. Pastrix: The Cranky, Beautiful Faith of a Sinner & Saint*, is her prayer-and-profanity laden narrative about an unconventional life of faith. Accidental Saints: Finding God in All the Wrong People* recounts her religious but not-so-spiritual path and perspective. Her newest book, Shameless A Sexual Reformation*, unleashes her critical eye, her sharp pen, and her vulnerable but hopeful soul on the caustic, fear-riddled, and religiously inspired messages about sex that have fed our shame.I first laid eyes on Nadia when she took the stage at The Nantucket Project to interview Lance Armstrong. Her opening line? “So, I see from my notes that you took some drugs you weren’t supposed to and then you lied about it? OMG. I did that shit SO MANY TIMES!”The crowd erupted. Instantly, I was hooked.Later that same weekend I witnessed Nadia deliver a sermon unlike anything I had ever experienced in church or otherwise. Wrapt by her charisma and compelled by her unapologetically honest message, I knew immediately I had to get her on the podcast.Growing up fundamentalist, at 12 she was diagnosed with Graves’ disease, a thyroid-related autoimmune disorder that caused her eyes to literally bug out of their sockets. Socially ostracized, rage and cynicism led a descent into drugs and alcohol. In 1991, a 12-step program ultimately lit her path back to faith — and the church she ultimately founded to create a home for those who have never felt home.Today we explore Nadia’s amazing story, set against the backdrop of her current focus: reforming Christianity’s historically toxic, fear-riddled obsession with sex that has fed our collective shame. Calling for a new reformation, her antidote in this holy resistance is grace, freedom, courage, love and hope. And her aim is to heal not only those who have been hurt but also those who have done the hurting.Courageous, vulnerable and acerbically funny, I adore Nadia and the message she shares today. Whether you are religious or atheist; spiritual or agnostic, we are all both sinners and saints. And this conversation — a far cry from your typical sermon — overflows with beauty and wisdom for everyone.However, if you are someone who has been mistreated, wounded or victimized by the shaming sexual messages so prevalent in religion — which obviously spills over into culture at large — then this podcast is appointment listening.Click here to watch our conversation on YouTube or listen on Apple Podcasts or Spotify.May grace and peace be with you.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

131,Brian Koppelman,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/brian-koppelman-427/,"Episode 427
March 8, 2019

 “Nobody has to give you permission to do the work that you want to do.”Brian KoppelmanToday’s guest was always creative, but never thought of himself of an artist.Then Brian Koppelman shifted his mindset. He adopted consistent daily practices to nurture his voice. He finally gave that voice the respect it deserved. And his life was forever changed.As direct result, this former music industry executive turned screenwriter, director, producer and showrunner has spent the last two decades churning out an avalanche of consistently great creative output as the co-writer (alongside lifelong friend David Levien) of iconic films like Rounders and Ocean’s 13 and co-creator a little hit show you might have heard of called Billions on Showtime.Today we convene for a fun and highly instructive conversation about the interior life of a master storyteller and modern day artist — and the lessons that can be gleaned from investing our own creative instincts.We discuss how he discovered Tracy Chapman while still in college, facilitated her first record deal, and the hows and whys behind walking away from the music business to pursue his dream of being a writer.We mine why devotion to process over results, mastery over success, and love of craft is the path to a meaningful life. We examine how to overcome negative self-talk and how Tony Robbins and Julia Cameron changed his life. And we dive deep into how his daily habits — journaling and meditation paramount among them — have paved his road to long-sustained success.But, as a long time admirer of Brian, what strikes me most is his generosity. A source of personal inspiration for my own creative endeavors, Brian shares his copious experience freely (what works, what doesn’t and why) on his twitter feed (@BrianKoppelman) and as host of The Moment — his stellar podcast in which he shares conversations with all manner of successful creative people about the pivotal moments that fueled their fascinating careers.I think of him as a benevolent mentor at large to anyone and everyone seeking to live more fully, creatively expressed lives of purpose and meaning.So how does he do it? What can we glean from his example, habits and practices that can inform how we think about ourselves as creative beings? And why is this important?Even if you don’t consider yourself creative, Brian will leave you questioning this assumption. Because deep down, we are all artists yearning to be fully expressed in that which makes us uniquely who we are. When we engage this inclination, the world is a better place.And we all deserve permission to do the work we want to do.Final Note: This conversation took place a few months ago while visiting NYC. Alas, my film crew did not join me, so this episode is audio only.Final Final Note: Season 4 of Billions returns to Showtime on March 17. If you’re new to the show, it’s truly appointment viewing. So take the next week to get caught up. Season 3 was unreal and I can’t wait to see what Brian, David and their amazing cast and crew have lingering up their sleeves. The only thing I know for sure is that we won’t see it coming.It’s both a delight and honor to share today’s exchange with a master storyteller. I sincerely hope you not only enjoy it, but that you put his sagacious wisdom to work.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

132,Chris Schuhmacher,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/chris-schuhmacher-426/,"Episode 426
March 5, 2019

“I knew I had to take ownership of what I did and regardless of the circumstances, I was going to try and become somebody different.”Chris SchuhmacherThis is a story of mistakes made. Of penance served. And the hard wrought path to atonement, self-forgiveness, and ultimately redemption.It begins with a young, standout volleyball player. A smart guy who later joins the Air Force, spending nearly two years at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA studying Korean.His career looked bright. But it wasn’t long before Chris Schuhmacher started making some bad decisions. A laundry list of errant decisions, in fact, that deposited him into a dark, hard partying crowd in Hollywood. Decisions that led to dealing weed to support that lifestyle. And decisions that ultimately culminated in a suitcase of drugs under his dispatch being stolen from him.In a drug and alcohol fueled rage, desperate and fearing the consequences should he be unable to retrieve the contraband, Chris took another manʼs life. And for that offense he was sentenced to sixteen to life.Well aware that he might never see another day outside San Quentin, inmate number T31014 nonetheless committed to taking responsibility for his actions. Searching for spiritual purpose and meaning, he got sober — and stayed that way. He made amends for his crime, began running and earned a college degree. He even studied software engineering, developing a promising app called Fitness Monkey under the tutelage of The Last Mile, a non-profit program that trains incarcerated individuals for successful reentry,All told, Chris transformed himself into the kind of person he always knew he could be.Then came the impossible. In 2017, after serving 17 years, a parole board granted him his freedom. Re-entry hasn’t be easy for Chris. But he has emerged from the experience a better man. Now a productive member of society reunited with his family and gainfully employed, he is intent on sharing his cautionary tale in service of others.I had the privilege of hearing Chris speak at The Nantucket Project last year. In a time where prisons and prisoners are mostly forgotten, I was deeply moved by his story of change, rehabilitation and improvement from the lowest points. And I was compelled to use this platform to better understand both his humanity and the current state of our prison industrial complex.There is no “un-doing” what Chris did. There can be no sufficient apology for taking a life. And yet there are lessons to be gleaned –both profound and instructive — from his deep dive into self-examination. The support he leveraged to reinvent himself wholesale. And the innovations afoot that can better rehabilitate the current and future incarcerated among us.Indeed, this is a story of drugs, alcohol, addiction, betrayal, anger, and tragically, murder. It’s about what currently ails our prison industrial complex. And it’s about how society can do better.But at its core, this conversation is about atonement. It’s about second chances. And it’s about empathy.With that, I urge that you entertain Chris’ testimony with an open mind and even more open heart.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

February 26, 2019

“Once you realize that you can do anything that you set your mind to, how you spend your time becomes a spiritual consideration.”Tom BilyeuLike most of us, Tom Bilyeu chased money for nearly a decade only to end up emotionally bankrupt.What this filmmaker and serial entrepreneur came to realize is that the struggle is guaranteed. The money is not. So you damn-well better love the struggle.Acting on this epiphany, Tom and his partners sold their technology company and founded Quest Nutrition — a play premised not on profits, but rather on creating value for people. Ironically, Quest exploded, becoming a billion-dollar business in roughly 5 years, making it the 2nd fastest growing company in North America according to Inc. Magazine.This is all very interesting of course, but it’s Tom’s next chapter that captured my curiosity. After exiting Quest, Tom embarked on a mission to truly empower people — an act of service aimed at eradicating, at scale, what he sees as an epidemic of impoverished mindset.Hence was born Impact Theory — a media company with a juggernaut talk show cornerstone in which he goes deep with all manner of inspiring people dedicated to positive transformation. The aim? To influence the cultural subconscious by building a single-minded content creation machine that makes exactly one type of content — content that empowers people.A long-time fan of Impact Theory, I had the good fortune of being a guest on Tom’s show a few months back. I walked away from that experience even more impressed with Tom. Sure, he’s über successful. And the legacy he is now building is as masterful as it is laudable. But it’s his generosity of spirit, matched with a keen and heartfelt curiosity, that left a lasting impression on me. The more I looked into this man and his mission, the more convinced I became that he would make a great guest for the show. And so here we are.This is an exchange designed to upend your sense of personal possibility. Shock you out of The Matrix. Change the story you tell yourself about yourself. Facilitate greater expression of the true self within. Access reservoirs of hidden potential. And ultimately become the best version of who you really are.And it all begins with changing your mindset.As someone who operates in a similar landscape, I have the upmost respect for Tom’s mission and him as a person. Chocked with practical advice and implementable takeaways from the frontlines of business, relationships, personal growth, self-improvement and everything in between, this conversation does not disappoint.To view our conversation on YouTube, visit bit.ly/tombilyeu425 And don’t forget we’re also now on Spotify here: bit.ly/rrpspotifyLet the master class begin!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

After 8-years of service, she retires to civilian life and begins to struggle mightily with re-acclimating to normalcy. Numb, she begins to withdraw from friends and family. Her only companion becomes chronic neck and knee pain. And her only solace the food she binges to salve her emotional wounds. 100 pounds heavier, she is then diagnosed with a potentially life-threatening, grapefruit-sized ovarian cyst.By April 2017, Sarah descends into a depression so bleak, she very nearly takes her own life.Today she tells her story — an inspiring tale of survival and service that begins with a bikeHowever, countless who suffer from PTSD never find their way out. In fact, 22 veterans take their own lives every single day.The very day I hosted this podcast was no exception. On November 7, 2018, just miles from my house, 28-year old combat veteran Ian David Long was planning an outlet for the dark thoughts he couldn’t shake. And just hours after Sarah shared her solution with me, Long succumbed to his pain. Pulling out a .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol with a laser sight, he opened fire on a crowd of 20-somethings gathered at the Borderline Grill in Thousand Oaks, killing twelve before fatally shooting himself.The confluence of these two events — and the disparity in their respective outcomes — perfectly underscores the severity of PTSD, our mental health epidemic at large, and the dire need for better diagnostics and more innovative treatment solutions for the untold millions who suffer.So let’s talk about it.This is a story about courage. It’s about healing. And it’s about redemption.I’ll let Sarah tell the rest.To view our conversation on YouTube, visit bit.ly/sarahlee424.

135,James Aspey,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/james-aspey-423/,"Episode 423
February 19, 2019

“I went voiceless because they’re voiceless.“James Aspey Why do we love dogs, eat pigs and wear cows?Dr. Melanie Joy coined this phenomenon speciesism.James Aspey calls it what it is — just plain wrong.Motivated to raise greater awareness for the planet’s voiceless victims, in 2014 this passionate, young, Australian animal rights activist took a 365-day vow of silence. After an entire year without uttering a single word, he ended it on Australian national television with an interview that inspired millions to make more conscious and compassionate lifestyle choices and cemented him as a charismatic new force in the fight for the ethical treatment of animals.Ranked #3 among the “Top 25 Most Influential Vegans” by Plant Based News, James has gone on to cycle 5000kms across Australia to prove that vegans can be fit & healthy. He got tattooed for 25 hours straight to raise $20,000 for charity. He’s been featured in a multitude of prominent mainstream media outlets; given free speeches at countless schools, universities, and conferences; and attended local activism events, slaughterhouse vigils, and street outreach events all across the world. He transparently shares his life and campaigns online to a massive tribe of global followers. On YouTube, his speeches have reached tens of millions of people. And his most popular speech has been viewed over 12 million views.Enthusiastic, accessible and highly skilled behind a podium, James is inspiring a new generation to change how we eat and live in communion with the animals that share this home we call Earth.But there’s so much more to this young man’s life than meets the eye. At 17, James was diagnosed with leukemia and told he only had 6 weeks to live. He beat the cancer only to slide into a life of drugs and alcohol punctuated by a profound eating disorder. Then a chance encounter with an Indian man would forever change the trajectory of James’ life.Today I’m proud to help this passionate defender of the voiceless share his powerful story.But first, a caveat. I’m not unaware that a contingent of you shut down when the subject turns to animal welfare. I know, because I used to be that person. I didn’t start out inherently compassionate about these issues. My shift to a plant-based lifestyle was initially motivated purely for personal health reasons. In fact it was years before I became sensitive to the horrific and inexcusable manner in which we treat our animal friends. But it’s an issue I now care deeply about. And it’s an issue we simply can no longer ignore or tolerate.Ghandi once famously said, “The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated.”History will not look fondly upon our track record. And I, for one, want to be on the right side of history.So for those who think this episode just isn’t for you, I urge you to set aside any judgment, projection or pre-conceived ideas you may have about James or this subject matter. Trust me. And open your heart. Because to move forward, we cannot continue to turn a blind eye.I really dig this conversation. I hope you do too. More importantly, I hope it inspires you to take positive action for change — both personal and global.To view our conversation on YouTube, visit bit.ly/jamesaspey423.

136,Todd Herman,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/todd-herman-422/,"Episode 422
February 12, 2019

“There’s a big difference between interested and committed.”Todd Herman What if I told you that one secret to success just might be adopting a secret identity?I know. It sounds weird. I too was skeptical. But today’s guest sold me with one unique thought:What if your alter ego is a more accurate representation of who you really are?Pondering this left me wanting to learn more. So I invited high performance coach Todd Herman on the show to elaborate.An author, advisor, and entrepreneur, Todd has spent the last 2 decades helping professional and Olympic athletes, entrepreneurs, leaders, and executives unlock peak performance at the highest level to achieve wildly outrageous goals while enjoying the process.Featured on the Today Show, Sky Business News, Inc. Magazine and CBC National News, Todd is also the author of the recently released book, The Alter Ego Effect: The Power of Secret Identities to Transform Your Life*. Equal parts instructive and entertaining, it’s a provocative exploration of the heroic self within as a means to overcome that which holds you back with one goal in mind — to empower greater expression of your inner best self.This conversation tracks the viability of Todd’s alter ego thesis through the lens of successful case studies who have used this strategy to their advantage. It explores the fraught terrain of actualizing peak performance and the proven strategies to maximize human potential. And it’s about how to best confront and overcome the hurdles that unnecessarily prevent the best of us – often repeatedly or in some cases continually – from inhabiting our most expressed selves.In addition, we explore the why behind Todd’s work. More specifically, Todd relates how confronting a severe childhood trauma helped him overcome profound feelings of guilt and shame that held him back for years. Impactful for anyone who suffers in silence, it’s a powerful story of healing and empowerment (but perhaps inappropriate for the little ones among us — so fair warning).Very much in the vein of my recent podcast with James Clear (RRP #401), I found this conversation both fascinating and entertaining. My hope is that you will too.To view our conversation on YouTube, visit bit.ly/toddherman422.

February 8, 2019

“Everybody wants the finish line. Everybody wants a medal. But people don’t want to put the work in.”Danielle GrabolIn 2010, the tireless and intrepid Jason Lester hoodwinked me into his latest fit of voluntary suffering insanity: an attempt to complete 5 Ironman-distance triathlons on 5 Hawaiian Islands in under 5 days. Hence was born the EPIC5 Challenge — and somehow we survived to tell the tale.Now institutionalized, EPIC5 annually attracts a global handful of athletes adequately unhinged to retrace our steps. Over the last 8 years, 29 individuals have successfully completed the challenge. Three of these intrepid humans are women. Two of them are here today.Meet real-life Wonder Women Danielle Grabol & Melissa Urie — both athletes thriving on the cutting edge of ultra-endurance.But it wasn’t always that way.Pushing 225 pounds, 15 years ago Dani was a junk food junkie and a pack-a-day smoker who couldn’t even climb a flight of stairs without losing her breath (sounds familiar!). In 2005, her doctor told her that if she didn’t change her ways she’d be dead before she turned 40.So she hit the gym. It was hardly overnight, but ultimately Dani reinvented herself wholesale. Down 70 pounds, an athlete was born. But on a training ride a year later, Dani was struck by a drunk driver. Her injuries were so severe she was told she would never run or bike again. Instead, she went on to compete in multiple Ironmans and even a double-Ironman. In 2013 she was one-half of the youngest two-person female team to finish RAAM — the legendary bike race across the entire United States. And in 2016, Dani became the very first female to compete in and finish EPIC5 — a stereotype shattering story she lays bare in her beautiful memoir, Fear No Distance*.A mental health nurse from Melbourne, Australia, Mel grew up active but never competitive. But in 1998, in an effort to lose a bit of weight and get fit, she participated in the Great Victorian Bike Ride with her dad. Thus was sparked a passion for ultra-endurance. Over the years, Mel has completed 6 Ironmans and a few double ironman distances races, including Ultraman Canada and Ultraman Australia*. Like Dani, she discovered EPIC5 by way of Finding Ultra, signed up and in 2017, Mel became the second female to ever complete the challenge.The bottom line? Mel and Dani are two badass women who know how to get it done. And this conversation is about just that.It’s about putting in the work. It’s about patience. Determination and grit. Not being afraid to fail. It’s about the mindset required to break stereotypes. And it’s about the mental toughness demanded to compete at the highest level in an arena dominated by men.So check your excuses at the door and enjoy!To view our conversation on YouTube, visit bit.ly/danielleandmel421.

February 5, 2019

“What is it all about? It’s about being healthier, happier, better to the animals, kinder to each other and the planet – and it all stems from what we’re putting into our bodies.”Marco BorgesLast week, Beyoncé and Jay-Z made news across the world with a headline grabbing offer: take the plant-based pledge and you just might win concert tickets for life.When the most culturally significant and influential entertainment couple on the planet throws down like this, it’s a big deal. The tectonic plates of social culture shift. Conventional attitudes and habits around food change. And our social paradigm is nudged forward.So what’s the story behind all this?The man behind this curtain isn’t a musician. No, Marco Borges is a trainer and exercise physiologist. He’s a family man and friend. He’s the person who first inspired Jay-Z and Beyoncé to adopt a plant-based lifestyle. He’s the entrepreneur that partnered up with the duo on 22-Days Nutrition. And he’s the environmentalist who enlisted the global icons in his latest venture, The Greenprint Project — a plant-based “blueprint” designed to shift your mindset, improve your health and impact the planet for the better.In addition, Marco is the author of multiple New York Times bestsellers, including The 22-Day Revolution*, The 22-Day Revolution Cookbook*, and his latest offering, entitled (you guessed it), The Greenprint: Plant-Based Diet, Best Body, Better World*. An inclusive, practical primer on all things plant-based, it’s a beautiful must read for anyone looking to lose weight, increase energy, boost metabolism or reduce your carbon footprint.Marco has been prominently featured in every major media outlet from Good Morning America to Vogue and today marks his third appearance on the podcast. If you’re new to the show, please check out episode #195 for Marco’s full backstory and episode #271, which features a panel discussion Marco and I conducted before a live audience at the Miami Seed Food and Wine Festival a few years ago.Today’s conversation pivots around the why behind Marco’s new Greenprint book and app. We discuss transcending labels. Marco’s focus on inclusivity over tribalism. And how mastering a few simple lifestyle changes can positively transform your life and the planet.Because I have grown quite close with Marco and his family, I can say with great conviction that he is the real deal. A man who walks his talk. A father, husband and entrepreneur who has devoted decades to empowering positive change in people from all walks of life. And so it is with delight and great enthusiasm that I share our latest conversation with you today. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed having it.To take the plant-based pledge and earn that shot at Jay-Z and Beyoncé tickets for life, visit thegreenprintproject.comTo view our conversation on YouTube, visit bit.ly/marcoborges420Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

January 29, 2019

“Only one [species] has the power to determine what level of suffering is acceptable for all other sentient beings to endure.”Damien ManderYou don’t want to fuck with Damien Mander.The very definition of an alpha-male modern warrior, Damien is a former Australian Royal Navy Clearance Diver (the Australian equivalent of the Navy SEALS) and Special Operations Military Sniper for the Tactical Assault Group East, an elite direct-action and hostage-recovery unit. Post-military career, Damien spent years as a private military contractor in Iraq, where his duties included training the local police force in Baghdad.But after 12 tours, disillusionment rendered Damien’s occupation no longer tenable. Burned out and cynical, an existential crisis precipitated a directionless walkabout. Seeking adventure, Damien ultimately found himself in Africa volunteering in the fight against big game poaching. Coming face-to-face with the horrors of this practice, an encounter with a pregnant wild buffalo viciously trapped and mortally injured by poachers basically changed Damien’s life – and sparked a new one altogether.Immediately thereafter, Damien began liquidating his personal assets, founded the International Anti-Poaching Federation (IAPF) and reinvented himself as an African wildlife crusader — a warrior leveraging his modern tactical warfare experience to advance the cause of animal welfare and environmental conservation to put an end to the barbaric practice that is big game poaching.Damien and the IAPF have had much success. But over time, Damien began to identify limitations in his highly militarized approach to solving the poaching problem. In 2017, this realization lead to his formation of Africa’s first armed, all-women anti-poaching unit. Dubbed the Akashinga (The Brave Ones), these incredible women have been incredibly successful at changing the way that animals are protected — arresting poachers without firing a single shot — and permanently changing the conservation landscape for the better.Damien’s work has been featured in National Geographic, 60 Minutes, Animal Planet, Al Jazeera, Voice of America, Forbes & The Sunday Times. He is prominently featured in the upcoming James Cameron produced, vegan athlete documentary Game Changers. And I highly recommend everybody watch his incredible TED Talk, Modern Warrior.A riveting tale you won’t want to miss, today Damien’s relates his transformation from ‘man’s man’ meat-eating mercenary to hardcore animal conservationist to women’s rights champion. His story is as extraordinary as it is inspiring. His work has completely changed the poaching and trophy hunting landscape. His heart is massive. And his example shifts the tectonic plates on how we think about masculinity and ecological responsibility in the modern age.It was an honor to spend time with Damien. He is a role model to me personally. A man I respect deeply. And a paradigm breaker if there ever was one.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange as much as I enjoyed having it. More than that, I hope it spurs you to action.

January 25, 2019

“Are you a fraud to society or a fraud to yourself?”Guru SinghWelcome to another edition Guru Corner featuring my favorite teacher on all things mystic and metaphysical, Guru Singh.Fusing Eastern mysticism with Western pragmatism, Guru Singh is a celebrated third-generation Sikh yogi and master spiritual teacher who has been studying and teaching Kundalini Yoga for more than 40 years. He is the author of several books, a powerful lecturer and behind-the-scenes guide to many a luminary, including Fortune 500 CEOs, athletes, and artists.A peer of rock legends like Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead, Guru Singh is also a supremely talented musician who began his recording career on Warner Bros’ Reprise label in the 1960s. When he isn’t laying down tracks with people like Seal, he’s bringing down the house on the daily at Yoga West, his Los Angeles home base.Today’s conversation focuses on the importance of cultivating your true self in a world that values conformity over individuality.Too many of us live disconnected lives. Lives led not mindfully, nor from a place of personal agency, but rather in reaction to external expectations and pressures. Personal expression is left repressed. The authentic voice is silenced. As a result, we suffer.No longer. It’s time to sing your song. May this conversation with one of my very favorite people help you find the notes.Note: If you missed my previous conversations with Guru Singh, start with episode 267 and then enjoy episodes 332, 368, 393 and 400.Final Note: You can watch our conversation on YouTube at bit.ly/gurucorner418 and the show is also now available on Spotify.Let the master class resume.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

141,Kílian Jornet,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/kilian-jornet-417/,"Episode 417
January 22, 2019

“Conquering mountains is an ironic phrase. We are not conquering them. We can never pretend to be fighting nature because we are part of it.”Kílian JornetNever meet your heroes, they say.Fortunately, this entire podcast is based on ignoring that advice. And today, that’s a good thing. First, Kílian Jornet — one of the most humble, accomplished and inspiring athletes in the world — rarely sits for long form press. Second, this hero lives up to the hype. And this conversation is everything I hoped it would be.For the uninitiated, Kílian Jornet is inarguably the most prolific and dominant mountain runner of all time and amongst the world’s greatest athletes, period. Born and raised at 6,000 feet above sea level in the Spanish Pyrenees, at age 5 he climbed an 11,000 foot mountain — the highest mountain in the region. Now Jornet adores the mountains with the same ferocity with which he runs them. Racking up wins in most of the world’s premier ultramarathons, his many accomplishments include:In search of inspiration outside formal competition, Kílian embarked on a self-styled adventure project dubbed Summits of My Life — establishing the fastest known recorded times (“FKT”) to ascend and descend the world’s most challenging peaks, including the Matterhorn, Kilimanjaro, Mont Blanc, Denali and even the planet’s tallest summit. Not only did Kílian set the Mt. Everest FKT at 26 hours from base camp, he did it without supplemental oxygen or ropes. A mere six days later, he repeated the performance — an accomplishment that inspired Adventurer of the Year accolades from National Geographic.Kílian’s feats of poetic athletic prowess are beautifully depicted in his gripping memoir Run Or Die*, the new documentary Path To Everest, and his latest book Summits of My Life* — all of which I urge you to check out.Today he shares his remarkable story. This is a conversation about what drives one of the planet’s most uniquely gifted fleet of foot — a man devoted to redefining what is possible, continually pushing the limits of human ability, and never failing to astonish competitors with his near-superhuman fitness and ability.So what lies behind the success? Kílian’s motivation isn’t what you might imagine. It has nothing to do with race results. And his happiness derives not from victory. Instead, it’s adventure that sparks Kílian’s joy. Immersion in nature. Living outside the comfort zone. And always, always exploring.A truly amazing human, what strikes me most about this other-worldly athlete is his profound humility. Kiílian’s passion and respect for nature’s prowess is earned. Refreshingly grounded, he lives simply, an ethic and aesthetic reflected in the minimalistic purity of his athletic pursuits.Today I’m glad I met a hero. I think you will be too.For the visually inclined, you can watch our entire conversation on YouTube at bit.ly/kilianjornet417 and the podcast is now available on Spotify.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“The opposite of addiction isn’t sobriety. It’s connection.”Johann HariWhy are we seeing unprecedented rates of depressions? What’s behind our current opioid epidemic? And what can be done about it?Journalist and author Johann Hari suggests that everything we think we know about addiction and depression is wrong.Johann has written for The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, and many other outlets. He was named ‘Newspaper Journalist of the Year’ by Amnesty International UK and his TED Talk, aptly titled  “Everything You Think You Know About Addiction Is Wrong”, was viral hit, with over 25 million views.Pertinent to today’s discussion, Johann is the author of Chasing The Scream*, which chronicles his 3-year investigation and research into the war on drugs and the nature of addiction. And his more recent book, Lost Connections* is a compelling deep dive into the nature of depression, its underlying causes and unexpected solutions.As many of you know, addiction and mental health are subjects of great personal importance. Better understanding that nature of these conditions is the motivating force behind this conversation, which is is everything I hoped it would be.This is an incredibly powerful, educational — and at times controversial — exploration into what drives these malignancies, why they are so difficult to overcome, and how a new approach can plot a more hopeful and solution-based course forward.Many see Johann’s ideas as radical. And although I don’t entirely agree with everything Johann prescribes, there is great wisdom in much of his findings.If you suffer from addiction or depression, this is a must listen. If you don’t, chances are someone you care for does. This conversation can provide the insight and tools for better understanding the struggle — because mental health truly impacts everyone.For the visually inclined, you can watch our entire conversation on YouTube at bit.ly/johannhari416 and the podcast is now available on Spotify.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“We’re able to give so much more when we take care of ourselves on a daily basis.”Chris HauthMaking his latest appearance in our ongoing Coach’s Corner series is none other than Chris Hauth, one of the world’s most respected endurance and ultra-endurance coaches.A sub-9 hour Ironman, Chris (@AIMPCoach) is a former professional triathlete, Age Group Ironman World Champion, and 2-time Olympic Swimmer. In 2006, Chris won the Ironman Coeur D’Alene and went on to be the first American amateur & 4th overall American at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii.When he’s not training and racing, Chris hosts the Weekly Word Podcast and runs AIMP Coaching, mentoring a wide spectrum of athletes ranging from elite professionals — including Ironman and Western States top finishers, Ultraman winners and Olympic Trials qualifiers — to first time half-marathoners.Whether you are an elite athlete or just starting out, Chris knows how to get the best out of athletes the right way. A long-time friend and mentor as much as a coach, I have been under Chris’ tutelage since 2008, during which time he deftly guided me through three Ultraman World Championships (’08, ’09 & ’11), EPIC5 in 2010 and the Ötillö Swimrun World Championships in 2017, an event we raced together as a team.I could have never achieved the level of athletic success I have enjoyed without Chris’ deft counsel, so it is with pleasure that I share more of his wisdom with you today.Today’s discussion centers around maintaining fitness engagement during the cold winter months, when the halo effect of your New Year’s resolutions have faded and inspiration tends to wane. We cover a wide variety of topics, including:2019 is now. Who you want to be come summer begins today. So let’s get after it.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.

January 8, 2019

“If we don’t reconnect with nature, we will just destroy it again.”Zach Bush MDIn my humble opinion, Zach Bush, MD isn’t just one of the most compelling medical minds currently working to improve our understanding of human and environmental health. He’s a virtuoso healer. A master consciousness. And a gift to humanity.Today Dr. Bush returns to the podcast (his first appearance was RRP #353 in March of 2018) for a formidable and moving conversation that will leave you rethinking not only how you eat and live, but what it means to be a conscious consumer and engaged citizen of this precious planet we all share.A pioneer in the science of well-being, Dr. Bush is the founder and director of M Clinic, an integrative medicine center in Charlottesville, Virginia, and one of the only ‘triple board-certified’ physicians in the country, expert in Internal Medicine, Endocrinology and Metabolism, and Hospice/Palliative care.How we treat the planet impacts human biology. Intuitively, we understand this to be fact. But what distinguishes Dr. Bush from his medical peers is his rigorous application of science, strength of humanity, and the intelligence of nature to his commitment to transforming our world. A man with a deep understanding of the interdependence of macrocosm and microcosm, Dr. Bush’s brilliance truly shines on subjects like soil degeneration and regeneration. The relationship between intensive farming practices and the rise of environmental degradation and chronic disease. And his vision for a more integrated and holistic approach to physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being.My initial conversation with Dr. Bush remains one of the most mind-blowing, impactful and popular discourses in the history of this show. Picking up where we left off, today’s episode exceeds all expectations — another conversation for the ages that will permanently alter how you think about everything from health, nutrition, disease, medicine, agriculture and environmentalism to what it means to be a spiritual being in this human experience we collectively share.It’s 2019 people. It’s time to stop screwing around. It’s time to get educated. And it’s time to once-and-for-all take control of our personal health and that of the planet we inhabit.I ask only that you listen keenly. Take notes. And no matter what, stick around to the very end. Zach concludes the podcast with what I can only describe as the most poignant and moving closing monologue in the history of this program – a bold statement I don’t make lightly.If you thought last week’s podcast with David Goggins was peak RRP, think again, Because today, the doctor is in.Final note: the podcast is now available on Spotify and viewable on YouTube at: bit.ly/zachbush414Final Final Note: My friend and team member David Kahn “DK” joins us this week for an extended introductory segment to discuss his health goals for 2019.

January 1, 2019

“You have to go to war with yourself before you can find peace”David GogginsI can think of no better guest to usher in 2019 than the mighty one himself.Incontrovertibly the most inspirational person I have ever met, today David Goggins returns for his second turn on the podcast — a conversation that will catapult you into the new year with the tools and hard truth you need to chase huge dreams, shatter personal limits and transform your life wholesale.Often referred to as the hardest man alive, David is the only member of the US Armed Forces to complete SEAL training (including three Hell Weeks), the U.S. Army Ranger School (where he graduated as Enlisted Honor Man) and Air Force Tactical Air Controller Training.But David is perhaps best known for his superhuman feats of strength and ultra-endurance.After several of his friends died in a 2005 helicopter crash while deployed in Afghanistan, David honored their memory by tackling the most difficult endurance challenges on Earth to raise funds and awareness for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, which provides college scholarships and grants to the children of fallen special ops soldiers.Hence began a most unexpected yet remarkably storied athletic career as one of the world’s most accomplished endurance athletes. Highlights include:But David’s greatest accomplishment isn’t athletic. It’s self-mastery.From day one, David has faced a concatenation of seemingly insurmountable obstacles – poverty, psychological and physical abuse, obesity, learning disabilities, asthma, sickle cell anemia, and even a congenital heart defect that often left him competing — and winning — on a mere fraction of his actual physical capabilities. It’s a scenario that would have buried the best of us. And yet, against all odds, David conquered them all, and ultimately found a way out.It’s the story of a man who transformed pain into obsession and, phoenix-like, rose from a state of utter desperation to take complete ownership of his life and total command of his mind to manifest a most extraordinary life.David’s implausible journey is laid bare in his recently released memoir, Can’t Hurt Me* — one of the most honest, powerful and impactful stories of hardship, redemption and personal perseverance I have ever read. Certain books instruct. Others inspire. But it’s the rare read that holds the potential to reframe your sense of personal capability and completely change your life. This book does just that — a statement I don’t make lightly. I highly suggest the audiobook version*, which is read by David’s co-writer (and my friend and former podcast guest) Adam Skolnick (RRP #218). Each chapter is followed by a compelling, off-the-cuff, free-form “podcast” conversation between Adam and David that takes the storytelling experience to an entirely new level.In addition to being one of the most remarkable people I have ever met, David has had a profound impact on me personally. It was his singular example that ignited my passion for ultra-endurance back in 2007 and fueled the self-belief required to pursue a new life. In truth, I’m not sure I would have achieved my athletic and life goals had he not blazed the path before me. I simply cannot ever repay the debt of gratitude I have for this man.I published my first conversation with David exactly 2 years ago (#RRP 266) on New Years Day 2017. He’s a podcast star these days, but that was his first real, long-form podcast. One of the most powerful conversations I’ve had the honor of hosting, it was a proud moment and remains my most popular and downloaded episode in the history of this show – by a long-shot.Today he returns. He’s better than ever. And also, not insignificantly, happier. A man who has vanquished his demons and emerged from the cave, finally at peace with himself and the world.Picking up where we left off, this is a brutally honest conversation about the primacy of self-ownership. It’s about passion and self-accountability. It’s about the limiting beliefs that hold us back and the importance of mindset to overcome them. And it’s about the embrace of obstacles and suffering as a crucible for growth and self-knowledge.Think of him as artist. His medium is his life. His message is that we all harbor a masterpiece within. And his example is that literally anything is possible.Welcome to 2019 people. It’s time to torch complacency.

148,Dean and Anne Ornish,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/dean-ornish-anne-411/,"Episode 410
December 16, 2018

“It’s not just about living longer, it’s about feeling better and improving the quality of life.”Dr. Dean OrnishToday we explore what it truly means to live healthy and well. It’s obvious that diet and exercise play a crucial role in this equation. Of course, mental health is key. And we’re waking up to the importance of meditation and mindfulness. But what about spirituality? What role do connection, relationships and love play in the wellness equation? And how important is purpose?In truth, attention to all such factors is crucial. Because they are indeed connected. Interdependent. And absolutely necessary to live your best life.Our guides for this discussion are Dean Ornish, MD & Anne Ornish — the world-renown, pioneering power couple of lifestyle medicine.An early advocate and practitioner of preventive medicine long before it was trendy, Dr. Ornish is an absolute legend in the plant-based nutrition movement for his groundbreaking work in the holistic prevention and reversal of chronic lifestyle diseases such as atherosclerosis, America’s #1 killer.Perhaps best known as the doctor who assisted President Clinton post heart procedure, Dean was trained in internal medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and the prestigious Massachusetts General Hospital. He is currently a Clinical Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and the president and founder of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito.The author of six best-selling books, Dean was recognized as a “Time 100 Innovator”; by Life magazine as “one of the 50 most influential members of his generation”; by People as “one of the most interesting people of the year”; and by Forbes as “one of the world’s seven most powerful teachers.Highly trained and experienced in lifestyle medicine, yoga therapy, mobile applications and web design, Anne Ornish is extraordinary in her own right. The creator behind Ornish Lifestyle Medicine’s digital platform, Anne is the powerhouse behind a new paradigm for health care by way of a groundbreaking program that trains health care professionals to support healthy lifestyle progression, better clinical outcomes, larger cost savings, and better adherence than ever before documented.Together they have co-authored a fantastic new book entitled, Undo It!: How Simple Lifestyle Changes Can Reverse Most Chronic Diseases* —  a comprehensive and scientifically proven plan to help you prevent and reverse everything from cancer and diabetes to heart disease, weight gain, and even the aging process itself. A must read, it bookstores everywhere January 8 and is currently available now for pre-order now*.Given Dean and Anne’s background, it would be fair to suspect that today’s conversation would be monopolized by diet. Of course we cover nutrition, including the scientific, peer reviewed research supporting the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle and how it measures up against other popular diet and nutrition protocols. But this exchange is also about the myriad of other crucial (and often overlooked or under-appreciated) factors imperative to consider in our personal health, wellness and longevity equation.We discuss the destructive role of stress and anxiety on the immune system. We go deep into mental health, our epidemic of depression and the curative impact of mindfulness and meditation. We explore the role of connection, meaningful relationships, intimacy and love on disease prevention. And we stress the importance of finding purpose as crucial to living truly well.But more than anything, this is a conversation not just about how to live well and long, but the why behind that desire.I’ve had the good fortune of hosting many a medical luminary on this show. But Dean Ornish stands above as the one doctor I’ve wanted to connect with ever since I began my journey. It took twelve years, but here we are. My hope is that his work will profoundly impact how you think, live, eat and breathe as we usher in 2019.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

149,Catra Corbett,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/catra-corbett-409/,"Episode 409
December 9, 2018

“Getting out is the first step.”Catra CorbettIf Ross Edgley is a real-life Aquaman, I nominate ultrarunner extraordinaire Catra Corbett as a real-life Wonder Woman.Definitely one of the planet’s most colorful athletes, Catra’s polychromatic goth-punk aesthetic is a perfect superhero costume match for her sparkling personality. Rocking wild rainbow hair, brightly colored running costumes and tattooed head-to-toe, you can spot the Dirt Diva’s smile from a mile out, happily tearing up the trails with her trusty side-kick training partner TruMan — a goggle-adorned mini dachshund. TruMan’s superpower? He loves running as much as she does.Yes, it’s all a bit nutty. But don’t be deceived — Catra is an absolute beast of an athlete. Over the course of her storied career she has competed in over 250 ultramarathons and is the first American woman to run over 100 miles or more on more than 100 occasions (137 to date).You might recall Catra from the book Born to Run as the “kaleidoscopically tattooed” woman who ran the 212-mile John Muir Trail from Yosemite to Mt. Whitney. When she reached the end, she didn’t stop. Instead, she turned around and ran back — a 425-mile effort for which she holds the fastest known time (FKT), completing it in just over twelve days. Not enough? Catra also holds the FKT for the Muir Ramble – clocking 324 miles in just 7 days. Oh yeah, she also ran 144 trail miles around Lake Tahoe in 43 hours on just 50 minutes of sleep.Most recently, at age 53, Catra completed three back-to-back 200-mile races to become the oldest woman to win the triple crown of 200’s (Bigfoot 200, Tahoe 200 & Moab 240). It’s an astounding feat she completed in just 10 weeks. A mere eleven days later she celebrated her accomplishment by running another 100 miles at the Javelina Jundred — dressed as the The Mad Hatter. Vintage Dirt Diva.To top it off, she’s a vegan — a lifestyle she adopted 15 years ago to which she attributes her high performance prowess, race consistency and longevity.Catra’s resume speaks for itself. But most impressive are the obstacles she has faced and overcome to become the shining example of humanity and athleticism she is today.Twenty-four years ago, Catra was lost in a hopeless spiral of meth addiction, disordered eating, and sexual and emotional abuse. Ultimately busted for peddling crystal, she hits rock bottom in a jail cell that scares her straight. Upon release she commits to getting sober, moves back home with her mother, abandons her lower companions, her boyfriend, and the dark lifestyle that she came to depend on. Her only clean friend pushes her to train for a 10K with him, and surprisingly, she likes it – and decides to run her first marathon after that.Sobriety saved her life. Running gave her a new one altogether. Along the way she attempts suicide, loses loved ones, falls in love, has her heartbroken, meets lifelong friends and finally faces the past that led to her addiction — all of which is beautifully chronicled in her memoir, Reborn on the Run: My Journey from Addiction to Ultramarathons*.I sat down with Catra to learn the how and why behind her incredible journey from meth-addicted cosmetologist to world class, vegan ultrarunning phenom.We cover her goth netherworld days and how she transformed her life in recovery. We track her accomplishments and what compels her insatiable drive to push herself well into her 50’s. And we talk about how and why she does it all vegan.I love this woman, her positive attitude and her infectious zest for life — a hero of sober possibility and the power of running to metamorphose wholesale.To view my conversation with Catra in all her technicolor glory, click here.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

150,Ross Edgley,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/ross-edgley-408/,"Episode 408
December 6, 2018

“You find the most honest version of yourself in complete exhaustion.“Ross EdgleyTo be certain, we face great challenges — global climate change, political divisiveness, mass shootings, social & economic disparity, chronic disease, addiction, racism, misogyny – the list goes on.It’s easy to fall into despair. And yet there is hope. Because heroes walk among us. Look closely and you will find no shortage of unsung angels diligently working anonymously behind the scenes to solve our collective crises. And literal superheroes who remind us that the human spirit knows no boundaries.I’ve had the good fortune to host more than a few such specimens on this podcast – people like Alex Honnold. James Lawrence who completed 50 ironmans in 50 states in 50 days. And Colin O’Brady, who, as we speak, is attempting to be the first person to cross Antarctica unaided.And then, there’s Ross Edgley – a gentle, beautiful beast of a man who recently became the very person to swim the entire circumference of Great Britain without once stepping on land. It’s a journey that took him 1,792 miles over 157 days, eclipsing several world records in the process – including the world’s longest staged sea swim.Ladies and gentlemen, meet the real Aquaman.And yet this just the latest feat for Ross, a UK-based strongman and adventure athlete of otherworldly grit and determination whose insane feats of strength and endurance include:Ross has chronicled his adventures as a fitness expert for magazines like Cosmopolitan, Men’s Health, GQ, The Daily Telegraph and Men’s Fitness and is a Sunday Times Bestselling Author of the aptly titled, The World’s Fittest Book*.I have both followed and admired Ross for many years. The Universe finally conspired to bring us together. And this conversation is everything I hoped it would be.Today we focus on the lessons Ross learned during his 5-month swim-circumnavigation of Great Britain.We explore the importance of purpose. Why you must succinctly understand what drives you — because if you cant explain what you’re preparing for in one sentence, it’s not clear enough.We talk about what it means to build work capacity. How to make peace with pain. And why strength and endurance need not be mutually exclusive pursuits.Ross’ achievements are an exploration of the outer limits of fortitude. We tap that well through the prism of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to better understand how mere survival can catalyze new horizons of human possibility.And we discuss Ross’ ongoing guinea pig ‘n of 1” experiment in human adaptability – the incredible ability he believes we all have to develop superhuman durability and it’s applicability beyond sport to literally anything.But more than anything, I wanted to know what compels this modern day Jack LaLane / Aquaman — and what it all means.Final note: this conversation took place in the midst of the Woolsey Fire a few weeks back. We were evacuated from my home and studio on the interview date thus we were not able to capture this conversation on video. Given the chaos, I’m just happy we could make it work at all. Special thanks to my friends Matthew Wilder and Tamara Dunn for allowing us use of their studio in Venice.I love this guy. It’s not just Ross’s astounding feats that drew me to his story. It’s how he comports himself that impresses me the most. So please enjoy the wisdom, experience and humor of one of the most extraordinary (and quite lovely I might add) people you will ever encounter.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

151,Jimmy Chin & Chai Vasarhelyi,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/jimmy-chin-chai-vasarhelyi-407/,"Episode 407
December 2, 2018

“If you’re going to make a film, it should be about something that is incredibly meaningful to you.“Chai VasarhelyiIf you enjoyed my conversations with adventure athletes Alex Honnold (RRP 351), Conrad Anker (RRP 170), Hilaree Nelson (RRP 364) and Colin O’Brady (RRP 207 & 235), then you are going to flip for today’s episode with Chai Vasarhelyi & Jimmy Chin — the dynamic and talented filmmaking duo behind the stunning new documentary Free Solo — a beautiful cinematic celebration of human possibility.A graduate of Princeton University hailing from New York City, Chai is an award-winning film director and producer with Hungarian, Chinese, and Brazilian roots who cut her filmmaking teeth under the legendary Mike Nichols. Her first film, A Normal Life, won Best Documentary at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2003. Her second film, Youssou N’Dour: I Bring What I Love, was released in theaters in the US and internationally. The film won numerous awards, including the Special Jury Prize at the Middle East International Film Festival in 2008 and a nomination for the Pare Lorentz Award at the 2009 International Documentary Association Awards.An award-winning cinematographer and director in his own right, Chai’s husband and creative partner Jimmy is also a professional climber, skier, mountaineer, 18-year member of The North Face Athlete Team and National Geographic Explorer. Over the past 20 years, he has led or participated in cutting-edge climbing and ski mountaineering expeditions to all seven continents and made the first and only American ski descent from the summit of Mount Everest. Known for his ability to capture the authentic in some of the world’s most high-risk environments, Jimmy has worked with many of the greatest explorers, adventurers and athletes of our time, documenting their exploits in the most challenging conditions and locations in the world. He has garnered numerous awards shooting on assignment for publications, including The New York Times Magazine, Vanity Fair and Outside Magazine, and has directed commercial work for a wide range of clients, including Apple, Chase, Pirelli and The North Face.Jimmy’s technical acumen matched with Chai’s storytelling superpowers have created two of the most compelling documentary masterpieces in recent memory. The highest grossing independent documentary of 2015, Meru* won the Sundance Audience Award, made the Oscars shortlist and was lauded by Variety as one of the best sports documentaries of its type in recent memory.Their latest collaboration, and the primary focus of today’s conversation, is Free Solo – a riveting, intimate, unflinching, edge-of-your-seat, sweaty-palm-inducing thrill ride portrait of Alex Honnold as he prepares to achieve his lifelong dream: a death defying quest to free solo the world’s most famous rock – the 3,200 face of El Capitan in Yosemite — without a rope.It’s an accomplishment the NYT called “one of the greatest athletic feats of any kind ever.”I concur — and cannot recommend this masterful film more highly.But there is so much more to Jimmy and Chai’s collaborative partnership — and the story behind Free Solo — than meets the eye.This is a conversation about about the power of story to inspire. To open people’s eyes to human possibility.We discuss the cross-pollination of Jimmy and Chai’s talents — how Chai’s strong background in serious nonfiction documentary work matched with Jimmy’s cinematic eye and 20 years of climbing expertise creates the perfect storm for adventure filmmaking that emotionally connects with a broad audienceWe talk about the purity, beauty and treachery of free solo climbing.We dive into the importance of trust, as well as the very serious ethical questions posed in making a film where the very real possibility always looms that their friend and the film’s protagonist could very well die.We explore the unique genius that is Alex Honnold. The diligence and attention to detail that he brings to his craft. His talent and drive. And the rigor and intentionality that he brings to his life. It’s a combination that captivates. Celebrates the human spirit. And reminds us that anything is truly possible.In addition, I urge you to check out the YouTube edition of this episode HERE, which features the full conversation supplemented with amazing clips from the movie itself.It’s a great honor to meet and converse with Chai and Jimmy. I sincerely hope you enjoy this exchange as much as I enjoyed having it.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

152,Wim Hof,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/wim-hof-406/,"Episode 406
November 25, 2018

“We are so successful at being comfortable that comfort is becoming the enemy of success.”Wim HofToday we dive into the deep end of higher consciousness. We challenge the limits of human potential. And we explore the power of the mind to unlock superhuman capabilities.Our instrument for this week’s fantastic voyage is Wim Hof — aka The Iceman. Dropping in for his second podcast appearance — his first being RRP 231 from June 2016 — Wim is a Dutch-born world record holder, adventurer, daredevil and human guinea pig best known for his preternatural ability to withstand extreme cold.More significant is Wim’s experimentation with specific and teachable breathing techniques. Rooted in the ancient yogic tradition of pranayama and canonized for a modern audience as The Wim Hof Method, Wim asserts that through such breath techniques he can turn up his internal thermostat and activate his sympathetic nervous system — abilities conventionally believed beyond conscious control.Understanding the far-fetched nature of his claims, Wim put his contentions to the test. Among his twenty world-record setting feats of otherworldly insanity, Wim has:All of this is seemingly insane. But Wim declares his feats not only replicable but entirely teachable — a curriculum that holds the potential to unlock a battery of human superpowers that extend well beyond extreme temperature tolerance to metabolic ‘reptilian brain’ functions previously thought beyond conscious manipulation.Picking up where we left off in RRP 231, this conversation focuses less on Wim’s feats of incredulity and more on the nature of consciousness and the primacy of its elevation. We discuss our current crisis of awareness. The importance of challenging long-held, status quo beliefs. And the warrior’s path required to live fully actualized.Wild, calm, powerful and gentle all at the same time, Wim is undoubtedly one of the most compelling and unique people I have ever met — a man who will shock you out of your comfort zone and call into question the countless unnecessary limits we impose upon ourselves daily.This journey begins with the breath. It extends to service, compassion, and gratitude. And it culminates in love.Disclaimer: Never practice breathing exercises before/during any activities where a loss of consciousness may prove life threatening. The breathing methods discussed may have a profound effect and should be practiced exactly as explained and always in a safe environment. Wim strongly advises you to gradually build up your exposure to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If not practiced responsibly, you risk hypothermia or worse. And finally, always consult your doctor first before beginning any exercise program.Online Course Discount: Wim was kind enough to offer my listeners 35% off his 10-week online course when you enter the code Rich35 at checkout before December 2, 2018 (this is Wim’s gift – I do not profit from this in any way).

November 18, 2018

“It’s hard to beat the person that won’t quit.”Lindsey Vonn What’s it like to be the very best in the world at something?Today I explore this question and so much more with a woman who truly needs no introduction.Not only is Lindsey Vonn the most decorated female skier in history, she’s the most decorated skier period – man or woman – in US history.One of the few world-class, four-event ski racers, Lindsey is a 4-time Olympian, a 3-time Olympic medalist, the only American woman to win downhill gold, and the only American woman with 4 World Cup titles. All told, she has 82 World Cup wins in her career, the most of any female skier in history. Only 4 World Cup wins now separate Lindsey from the record set by Ingemar Stenmark in 1989.Eclipsing this once thought untouchable achievement is the final goal propelling Lindsey into her final professional season.Off the slopes, Lindsey is a media mogul. A regular on “Most Marketable” athlete lists, she has been profiled in every major media outlet across the globe and graced the cover of publications such as Fitness, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, TV Guide and many others.Not enough? Lindsey sank a hole-in-one during one of her very first full 18 holes of golf. So there’s that.Lindsey’s victories are self-evident. Less appreciated are the countless obstacles she has faced and overcome over the course of her legendary career. From potentially career-ending injuries to debilitating bouts with depression to weathering the haters and naysayers, Lindsey’s trajectory skyward has been neither linear nor charmed. In point of fact, she has tenaciously fought for all everything she has achieved – falling and failing often.Her motto? When you fall, get right back up. And never, ever quit.It’s Lindsay’s fearlessness and relentless persistence that most impresses  — qualities I explore as the focus of today’s conversation.So what drives this champion? And what can we learn from her mindset, process and experience?Listen, learn and enjoy.Note: the podcast is now available on Spotify and our conversation is viewable in full on YouTube at bit.ly/lindseyvonn405Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

November 15, 2018

“Be kind to yourself, to other people, animals and the Earth.“Jason Flom Today I sit down with music industry titan Jason Flom for a deep dive into what currently ails our criminal justice system, and how to fix it.The current CEO of LAVA Records, Jason’s much storied career features stints as Chairman and CEO at Atlantic Records, Virgin Records and Capitol Music Group. He is personally responsible for launching a litany of massive acts, including Kid Rock, Katy Perry, Lorde, and most recently Greta Van Fleet. The New Yorker described him as “one of the most successful record men of the past 20 years…known for his specialty in delivering ‘monsters.”Jason’s accomplishments in the recording industry are extraordinary. But it’s his commitment to criminal justice justice reform that compelled this conversation. A founding board member of The Innocence Project as well as a board member of several advocacy organizations devoted to drug reform, prison education and ant-recidivism, Jason is a leading civilian expert on clemency with a talent for procuring exonerations for those wrongfully convicted.A sought-after public speaker on such matters, Jason also hosts the Wrongful Conviction podcast, which features mesmerizing interviews with men and women who have spent decades in prison for crimes they did not commit. A means of exposing what ails our current justice system and prison industrial complex, his goal is to promote alternatives to mass incarceration and offer ideas on how to reduce the indecencies of wrongful convictions.Although I have followed Jason’s work for years, I had never met nor heard him speak until our paths crossed at The Nantucket Project a few months back. At the conclusion of his riveting, standing-room-only presentation alongside Amanda Knox — the exchange student who spent almost 4 years in an Italian prison following a murder conviction Jason played a part in having overturned — there wasn’t a dry eye in the house.I knew immediately I wanted to share his story and work with all of you. Today is that day.This is a compelling exchange about what ails our criminal justice system and how to fix it.It’s about systemic inequities and the recurring issue of false confessions — why so many innocent people plead guilty. We discuss the impact of DNA testing technology, overcoming prosecutorial malfeasance, and how unaffordable bail exacerbates social inequality. But mostly, this is a conversation about how misaligned incentives often produce unjust results and why Jason is so committed to giving a voice to those wrongfully incarcerated.But I couldn’t let him go without a peek into his legendary music career. Stories from the frontlines, he recounts how he discovered Lorde, the current state of rock and roll, and his new venture, aptly titled, The Church of Rock and Roll.My hope is that this conversation will provoke a deeper sense of empathy for those that suffer. Motivate you to investigate these issues more thoroughly. And inspire you to get involved in forging solutions.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

November 11, 2018

“There’s no more nutrient dense way to eat than a plant-based diet.”Josh LaJaunieI have never met a more inspirational everyman example of healthy, transformative living than Josh LaJaunie.After 400+ episodes of the podcast, our initial conversation way back in December of 2013 (RRP 63) remains one of my favorite and most popular episodes in the history of the show, followed closely by our second conversation in June 2015 (RRP 152).There’s a reason for that.Sure, Josh lost 200+ pounds. He overcame tremendous obstacles to restore and maintain his health. He reinvented himself as athlete, crushing marathons, winning an ultra and even gracing the cover of Runner’s World magazine.You might have seen Josh on The Today Show. Perhaps you caught him on Good Morning America. Certainly, Josh’s personal triumphs are worthy of celebrating. But I’m emphatic it’s his giant heart that captured the the media’s eye.100% genuine and utterly authentic, it’s Josh’s love and devotion to returning the gift in service of his friends, family, community and strangers that sets him apart — and makes me prouder than you can imagine to call him friend.Good things happen to good people who do good for others.For those new to the show, Josh’s story — as laid out in his self-described manifesto — begins in marshy southern Louisiana. A self-avowed “swamp dweller” from Bayou Lafourche, he was a big kid surrounded by an even bigger loving family, united by their shared adoration of food. Despite being recruited to play college football, college life left him so disillusioned, he dropped out, returning home aimless and unmoored. He found work in the family construction business, but like so many, started living for the weekend: partying, hunting, fishing, cheering for his beloved New Orleans Saints, and feasting on his favorite local delicacies — po boys, jambalaya & barbecue. Lots of barbecue. It’s just what you do down in Bayou Lafourche.It wasn’t long before Josh tipped 400+ on the scale. Outwardly he seemed fine with it. But deep down he was dying — his despair, embarrassment and shame escalating in lockstep with his declining self-esteem and overall well being.Then something happened.  In 2010, Josh’s beloved Saints achieved the impossible, winning the Super Bowl. It seems a small thing. But to Josh it was everything. Forever altering his perception of what is possible, he began to question the limits he imposed upon himself. Empowered, he began to “let go of his normal” and dismiss the embedded “that’s just the way it is down here” mentality he was starting to understand often taints the logic of his region.A chain reaction of events ensued that set Josh on a path that literally changed everything. He adopted a 100% plant-based diet. He resumed a long, slow return to fitness. He committed to a top-to-bottom mindset shift. It wasn’t overnight, but today he has multiple marathons under his belt. An ultramarathon victory. And a plan to scale the principles that saved his life to save others via his Missing Chins secret Facebook group and newly-hatched WellStart wellness start-up.The best part? It’s just the beginning.Picking up where we last left off, this is Josh’s story. It’s a tale about what can be accomplished when self-care meets selfless service. It’s a conversation certain to erase the trusty excuses that stand between you and the person you aspire to become. And it’s a powerful reminder of the great potential that resides within all of us to live well beyond the limits of our wildest imagination.I am proud to once again give Josh a well-deserved microphone to share his powerful, continually evolving tale of triumph.I said it before. I’ll say it again. You’re a good man Josh LaJaunie.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

November 4, 2018

“Raising crops to feed animals so we can eat animals is vastly inefficient.”Bruce Friedrich 7.5 billion people currently share this spinning blue planet we call Earth. By 2050, that number will escalate to 9.7 billion. By 2100? 11 billion.How can we possibly feed 11 billion people sustainably?To answer that question we must turn our gaze to the industrialization of animal agriculture. On the surface, what we commonly call factory farming appears incredibly efficient, creating massive economies of scale to feed the maximum number of people possible.But in actuality, this industry is inexcusably inefficient and unsustainable long-term. It requires untold amounts of land, water and feed. It contributes more greenhouse gas emissions that the entire transportation combined. It’s depleting our soil. It’s polluting our water table. It’s acidifying our oceans. It’s making us sick. And it’s driving the greatest mass species extinction in the history of mankind. In fact, 60% of all animal species have been rendered extinct in just the last 50 years.We can’t continue down this path. We desperately need a better way.So let’s talk about it. This week I sit down for a second conversation with Bruce Friedrich, a leading innovator in food systems and policy.Bruce is the executive director of The Good Food Institute and founding partner of New Crop Capital, organizations focused on replacing animal products with plant and culture-based alternatives. He graduated magna cum laude from Georgetown Law and Phi Beta Kappa from Grinnell College, holds additional degrees from Johns Hopkins University and the London School of Economics and was inducted into the United States Animal Rights Hall of Fame in 2004.A popular speaker on college campuses — including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, and MIT — Bruce has appeared on NBC’s Today Show, CNN, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, and Court TV.Picking up where we left off in April 2017 (RRP 286), Bruce brings us up to speed on the rapidly evolving frontier of food technology and plant-based innovation, including a fascinating deep dive into the cutting edge of clean meat and the revolutionary science that is making possible the production of animal foods by way of cultured cells harvested without slaughter.This is a conversation about the politics of agriculture and the subsidies, corporations, representatives and lobbyists that support it.Bust mostly, this is about current advances designed to improve food systems in the interest of human, animal and planetary well-being.Humanity currently faces an unprecedented, seemingly insurmountable environmental crisis. But Bruce casts an optimistic forecast — how technology, urgency and popular demand are rapidly converging to create healthy, sustainable and compassionate solutions to help solve our current food, health and environmental dilemmas.Chock-a-block with incredible information, this exchange will leave you not only better informed on the aforementioned subjects, but inspired to invest more deeply in where your food comes from, how it impacts the precious world we share and how together we can forge the future of food for ourselves and generations to come.Incredibly intelligent, considerate and measured, it was an honor to sit down with Bruce. I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

October 28, 2018

“True behavior change is really identity change.”James ClearWhat stands in the way of becoming the person you aspire to be?Maybe it’s circumstances. Access or opportunity. For many its bad habits, exacerbated by the unsuccessful war waged to replace them with good habits — a rinse and repeat process that generally leads to failure and discouragement.Why is it so hard to overcome negative patterns?Today’s guest contends the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system.Evolving from stuck and unsatisfied into the person you wish to become is equal parts art and science. Science helps explain the root causes of our behaviors and how to modify them. But the application of said principles into practice is very much an art.Today we explore the often misunderstood terrain of behavior change with author James Clear, a man who has spent the better part of his career attempting to understand and master the art and science of human habit formation and decision-making,A regular speaker at Fortune 500 companies, James’ work is used by teams in the NFL, NBA, and MLB. He has been featured in the New York Times, Entrepreneur, Time, and on CBS This Morning. His website jamesclear.com receives millions of visitors each month. Hundreds of thousands subscribe to his popular e-mail newsletter. And over 10,000 leaders, managers, coaches, and teachers have built better habits in life and work via his Habits Academy online program.James recently penned Atomic Habits, a New York Times bestselling deep dive into evidence-based self-improvement. A comprehensive primer on what actually works when it comes to behavior change, it zeroes in on the transformative power of making small changes. Packed with implementable takeaways (including many strategies I have myself employed with great success), it’s a must read for anyone looking to take their life to the next level.This is a highly practical conversation that explores the psychology and neuroscience behind behavior change.Specific topics include the problem with goals. We discuss the relationship between overly ambitious goals and failure — why most people make the mistake of optimizing for the finish line when we should instead focus on getting to the starting line.James explains why establishing systems are critical; and why focus should be placed on practice over performance.We also cover why it’s important to move beyond temporal, emotional drivers like motivation into practical action. Why you’re more likely to act yourself into feeling rather than feel yourself into action.Or, as I like to say, mood follows action.My biggest takeaway from this exchange is James’ compelling dissertation on why we are best served by concentrating on identity. In other words, long-term results are best derived not from achieving the goals we set for ourselves, but instead by slowly adopting and inhabiting the daily practices and characteristics of the person we aspire to become.Powerful and potentially game-changing, this conversation will reframe how you contemplate and act upon your ambitions.

October 25, 2018

“If we don’t allow ourselves to be imperfect we will never get good.”Guru SinghWelcome to another edition Guru Corner — a spiritual version of my popular Coach’s Corner series featuring my favorite teacher on all things mystic and metaphysical, Guru Singh.Fusing Eastern mysticism with Western pragmatism, Guru Singh is a celebrated third-generation Sikh yogi and master spiritual teacher who has been studying and teaching Kundalini Yoga for more than 40 years. He is the author of several books, a powerful lecturer and behind-the-scenes guide to many a luminary, including Fortune 500 CEOs, athletes, and artists.A peer of rock legends like Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead, Guru Singh is also a supremely talented musician who began his recording career on Warner Bros’ Reprise label in the 1960s. When he isn’t recording tracks with people like Seal, he’s bringing down the house on the daily at Yoga West, his Los Angeles home base.Over the last couple years, I have grown quite close with Guru Singh, a beautiful and highly relatable consciousness I’m proud to call friend, family and mentor. It’s a privilege to share more of his powerful wisdom with you today.A companion piece to my recent podcast with author and parenting expert KJ Dell’Antonia (RRP #396), today’s conversation is an intimate exploration into the art of parenting through the lens of child rearing as spiritual practice.We discuss the challenges of raising a generation required to face problems created preceding generations.We pit the perils of social media against the importance of digital fluency.We explore the importance of cultivating a healthy sense of self amidst the chaos of family life; how to reframe failure as opportunity; and the importance of balancing discipline while encouraging daydreaming.Communication is paramount, so we dissect strategies for keeping it open and honest.None of us parent perfectly. But the way forward is to better master ourselves, our actions and reactions. My hope is that this exchange will empower you with some tools to do just that.Like my conversation with KJ, there is plenty of wisdom here for everyone, irrespective of your child rearing status. So even if you don’t have children and never plan to, I encourage you to listen or watch with an open mind.Note: If you missed our initial conversations, start with episode 267 and then enjoy episodes 332, 368 and 393.Final Note: The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube HERE (just make sure to subscribe!)Let the master class resume.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

October 21, 2018

“Charity means love. It means to look after your neighbor in need and get nothing in return.”Scott HarrisonFrom the outside looking in, he was living the dream.Killer SoHo loft. Private jets to exotic locales. Rolex, cover model girlfriend and cash. Lots of cash.But ten years living extravagantly as a decadent nightclub promoter in New York City took it’s toll.By 28, Scott Harrison had become the worst person he knew.Morally bankrupt and desperate to rediscover his sense of purpose, Scott decided it was time for a drastic change. So he sold all his belongings and decamped NYC for a year spent volunteering aboard a hospital ship off the coast of Liberia, West Africa.Abroad, Harrison witnessed levels of poverty and illness he never knew existed. As one year turned into two, he came to understand that many of the diseases their group treated were waterborne, easily preventable with access to clean drinking water — a basic need sorely lacking across vast swaths of the undeveloped world.Upon returning to New York in 2006, Scott turned his full attention to the global water crisis and the (then) 1.1 billion people living without access to clean water. The manifestation of that commitment is charity: water — a revolutionary for-purpose endeavor that to date has raised over $3000 million to bring clean drinking water to more than 8.4 million people all across the world.Equally impressive is the extent to which Scott has quite literally reinvented and re-energized how we give and how we think about giving. He did it by creating an aspirational brand. He did it by restoring public trust in charity. And he did it by leveraging technology to deeply connect each and every giver with the gift’s specific result and impact.Simply put, Scott Harrison is one of the most impressive people I have ever met. His inspiring story from lost to found is legend — an astounding example of what can be achieved when a life pivots from self-serving to selfless service.Scott’s story can be found in his riveting new memoir, Thirst, which vividly recounts Scott’s redemptive tale of transformation and the twists and turns that built charity: water into one of the most trusted, disruptive, innovative and admired nonprofits in the world. Debuting at #7 on last week’s NY Times bestseller list, it’s a must read page-tuner, the profits of which funnel right back to (you guessed it) charity: water.**Picking up where left off in Scott’s first appearance on the podcast (episode 305 from July 2017), today we dive deeper into previously unexplored aspects of Scott’s personal evolution. We discuss progress made by his organization and the work that remains.We discuss the important role faith has played in his journey. He explains the true meaning of charity — and the sense of purpose and personal fulfillment that goes hand in hand with service. We end with a call to action. And a reminder that we all possess the power to make the world a better place.Because nobody should fear work that has no end.Here’s my call to action: in celebration of my 52nd birthday, help me raise $100,000 by December 31, 2018 — 100% of which will be deployed to bring clean water projects to over 3,300 people for the very first time. Projects that will save lives for generations to come.Specifically, I’m asking that you donate $1 for every year that I have been drinking clean water – a pledge of $52 (or whatever you can afford – every penny helps). When the water projects are complete, charity: water will then send all of those who donated photos and GPS coordinates so together we can experience up close and personal the exact community that we impact.It’s an ambitious goal. I can’t do this alone. But with your help, it’s entirely doable. Because together we are powerful. For the price of a night out at the movies, we really can save lives and positively change the world. And that is priceless.For more information and to donate, please visit my campaign page at my.charitywater.org/richroll.My hope is that this conversation inspires both self-reflection and action. Because each and every one of us holds the power to positively impact the life of another. And because life is more fulfilling, meaningful and rewarding when we are persistently engaged in the pursuit of service and giving.I love this man. I love his mission. And I love this conversation.For the visually inclined you can watch our entire conversation here: bit.ly/richandharrisonytPeace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

160,Jamie Dornan & Sacha Gervasi,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/jamie-dornan-sacha-gervasi-398/,"Episode 398
October 14, 2018

“You can have everything. But if how you see everything is wrong, you have nothing.”Sacha GervasiToday I sit down with actor Jamie Dornan and filmmaker Sacha Gervasi, a man I love dearly and have known for over 20 years, to discuss their recent collaboration — My Dinner With Hervé, a brilliant new film premiering October 20 on HBO.Marking his 2nd appearance on the show (his first being episode 249 two years ago), Sacha’s credits include scripting The Terminal, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks. In 2012, Sacha directed Hitchcock starring Anthony Hopkins and last year helmed November Criminals featuring Ansel Elgort and Chloë Grace Moretz.But Sacha is perhaps best known for Anvil! The Story of Anvil, his Emmy and Independent Spirit Award winning, real-life Spinal Tap rockumentary about an also-ran Canadian heavy metal band that many critics consider one of the greatest films ever made about rock and roll.Anvil explored what it means to never give up on a dream. Hervé picks up where Anvil leaves off, exploring the darker aspects of lofty dreams realized in a tragic comedy that lays bare the power of unchecked ego, addiction, and unhealed childhood trauma in fueling self-destruction.A look at the wild life of French actor Hervé Villechaize, who famously played Tattoo in the hit ’70s TV series Fantasy Island, the film is based upon one insane night Sacha spent with Hervé (played by Game of Thrones’ Peter Dinklage) just one week before Hervé’s suicide, and the emergence of an unlikely friendship that permanently alters both of their lives.His very first script, it’s a movie Sacha began writing over 20 years ago. Both hilarious and sad, beautiful and surprisingly emotional, Hervé is hands down Sacha’s best work to date. Peter Dinklage is a tour de force. And Jamie Dornan — as Danny Tate, a journalist loosely based on Sacha — delivers in an elegantly nuanced, powerful performance that will leave you with a new appreciation for this actor’s depth and talent.Jamie is of course most recognized for his portrayal as Christian Grey from the 50 Shades of Grey movies. But if that’s all you know about this young man, you’re in for a delightful surprise. I first came across Jamie’s work several years ago by way of The Fall, a dark psychological thriller series co-starring Gillian Anderson, and was immediately struck by his keen ability to evoke pathos and empathy for a seemingly irredeemable character. But Hervé is a game changer for Jamie — a role I’m certain will leave unsuspecting audiences with a new and grand appreciation for this actor’s considerable talents.On the surface, Hervé is about how a chance encounter between two people in various states of desperation find solace in each other’s pain. One survives to embark on a new life. The other does not. Between the lines, the movie — and this conversation — is about not giving up on a dream. Hervé risked everything to become a star. And it took 20 years of persistence for Sacha to see this vision realized. But it’s how one navigates success and failure that ultimately determines that which we truly seek — fulfillment, purpose, and of course happiness.Today we explore these themes. We discuss our predisposition to judge people based solely on their outsides. We dive deep into the delusion of fame. What happens when we pervert the need to be seen. And the emptiness purchased when we seek validation outside ourselves to salve the pain of life.On a personal note I can’t express how proud I am of Sacha and the dogged patience he demonstrated to bring this vision to the screen. His perseverance is as inspiring as the product of his steadfastness. But it’s who he has become as a man and a friend that electrifies me most.This one is really fun. Both these guys are hilarious and super insightful. I sincerely hope you enjoy it. And please make a point of seeing the movie when it hits small screens everywhere on HBO October 20.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

October 10, 2018

“Being vegan doesn’t hold you back from anything and in fact, it might make you better at what you want to do.”Keegan KuhnToday’s episode features a conversation conducted before a live audience at the Laemmle Royal Theatre in Los Angles with acclaimed British ultra-runner Fiona Oakes and friend, multiple podcast guest and filmmaker Keegan Kuhn — one-half of the team behind both Cowspiracy & What The Health.Vegan since she was 6 years old, Fiona is an extraordinary athlete and exemplary human hailing from the UK who holds four world records for marathon running. Perhaps best known as the world’s fastest woman to run a marathon on all seven continents and the North Pole, in 2013 Fiona won both the Antarctic Ice Marathon and the North Pole Marathon. But what makes her accomplishments all the more amazing is that at age 14 she was told she would never walk properly, let alone run, due to an illness that required more than 17 radical knee surgeries that culminated in the removal of her entire right knee cap.This week marks the release of this dynamic duo’s latest creative collaboration, a new documentary entitled Running For Good. Visually arresting, the film follows Fiona as she attempts to set a new world record and complete Marathon des Sables – a 250km race through the Sahara routinely dubbed the toughest footrace on Earth.Fiona runs not for podiums or glory, but instead to promote a compassionate way of living and break the stereotype that veganism holds you back from anything — all while tending to her true passion, operating Tower Hill Stables, where she cares for more than 450 rescued animals everyday.A departure from Keegan’s recent provocative fare, Running For Good is a more contained yet cinematically stunning portrait of an undeniably unique, compelling, funny, self-deprecating, inspiring and essentially anonymous figure deserving of far more notice, attention and acclaim than she has historically received.Executive produced by actor James Cromwell, I had the honor of providing some voice over to the film, as well as co-hosting the recent LA premiere of the film several weeks ago, where we recorded this conversation — which includes clips from the movie itself — post-screening before a live audience.Fiona is someone I respect and admire deeply and have wanted to get on the show for a very long time. My admiration for Keegan and his work is well documented by his many appearances on this show. So I’m delighted to bring them together for you today. In addition, we are setting a new audio production high water mark in this episode. Jason Camiolo (who composed the film’s beautiful score) did a masterful job weaving segments of the film into today’s exchange to elevate the dynamic quality of your listening experience.Big Announcement: Running For Good premieres globally on Vimeo October 11, 2018. For the first four (4) days of release (October 11-14), Keegan is generously making the film available to stream for FREE to the public.

October 7, 2018

“Our kids don’t need the burden of our happiness on top of theirs.”KJ Dell’AntoniaAs every parent will attest, it’s so easy to sublimate one’s self care for the interest of a child’s needs – it’s basically programmed into our DNA.Intellectually we understand you can’t truly take care of another unless you attend to your own well-being first. But this idea runs counter to every parental instinct, making it very difficult to practice this important principle. It feels selfish. But our selfless intentions, albeit good, can lead us astray. Not only do they undermine our well-being, they’re not in our kids’ interest either — because an unhappy parent does not a happy child make.This is a solid solid life lesson, whether you have children or not.So let’s talk about it. While the vast majority of parenting advice focuses on raising happy children, today’s conversation flips the lens to concentrate on the radical, almost verboten subject of how to be a happier parent.To walk us through this hornet’s nest is KJ Dell’Antonia, a former New York Times reporter who wrote and edited the Motherlode blog from 2011-2016 and was a contributing editor to the Well Family section from 2016-2017.In addition, KJ co-hosts the #AmWriting podcast with parenting expert Jessica Lahey, author of The Gift of Failure* (and former amazing podcast guest) and recently authored the new, aptly titled book How To Be A Happier Parent*, a delightfully instructive, solution-packed, and research-backed primer aimed at helping parents find more happiness and joy in their day to day lives.This is a very fun conversation loaded with practical advice and easy-to-implement take-aways for the parents among us. But even if you don’t have children, there is plenty of wisdom here to mine. The principles discussed are applicable to all, irrespective of your child-rearing status.Because more than anything, this is a discourse on a crucial aspect of happiness we all share: self-care.Specific topics covered include how we can all do more by doing less (something I really need to work on).We discuss the problem spots that cause parents the most grief, with very small and doable steps to create a family life that serves as a pleasurable refuge rather than another stress point.We talk about the importance of promoting self-sovereignty in ourselves and our children so they mature into happy, independent self-regulators.And it’s a conversation about what family is really all about: not just churning out great kids on a success trajectory, but joy.It was a joy spending time with KJ. My hope is that you feel the same and leave this conversation with ample fuel to better the quality of your life and family.For the visually inclined you can watch it all go down here: bit.ly/richandkjPeace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

September 30, 2018

“The truth is the teacher. If I just tell the truth, it will have a message.”Jedidiah JenkinsThe late Anthony Bourdain once said, “Travel changes you. As you move through this life and this world you change things slightly, you leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life – and travel – leaves marks on you. Most of the time, those marks – on your body or on your heart – are beautiful. Often, though, they hurt.”I think this quote beautifully captures the ethos of today’s conversation. Travel as an agitator of self-understanding. A template to deeply explore the deep intertwined relationship that lives and breathes in that beautiful space between adventure and identity.Our cipher for this transcendent voyage — how exterior horizons influence scrutiny of our interior landscape — is many things: author, global adventurer, social entrepreneur, human rights activist, lawyer, filmmaker, and magazine publisher.But labels fail to capture what makes Jedidiah Jenkins special. Let’s just call him beautiful human.I can’t quite recall how today’s guest first came across my radar. What I do remember is happening upon his rather stunning Instagram feed as he neared the end of a spectacular bicycle-powered journey that took him from Oregon to Patagonia.Each photograph more arresting than the one prior, every image conveyed it’s own story that perfectly informed an engaging larger narrative. But it’s Jedidiah’s accompanying entries — beautifully composed, contemplative and quite poetic — that set his feed apart. Writings themed less by place than interior geography, it’s Instagram as dynamic journal — an experiment in blogging that camps out hundreds of miles beyond any travelogue, blog or vlog you’ve ever before seen.I was hypnotized. Who is this guy?A graduate of the USC School of Cinematic Arts and Pepperdine University School of Law, Jedidiah began his professional career as one of the founding leaders of Invisible Children, the small non-profit that overnight became world renown courtesy of a little social justice campaign you might have heard of called #Kony2012– a campaign that redefined internet virality.The progeny of adventurer journalist parents who quite famously graced the cover of National Geographic walking across America in the 1970’s, I think it’s fair to say that despite his desk-bound legal career, Jedidiah and the outdoors had a little destiny to sort out. And so, to celebrate his 30th birthday, Jedidiah quit the job he loved to unconsciously follow in his parents’ footsteps, scare himself, embrace the unknown and, like a character out of a Mark Twain novel, light out on the territory.Three years ago, I invited him on the podcast to share the story of his sixteen-month, 10,000 mile journey. To date it’s one of my favorite conversations in the history of this podcast. That day I made him promise to return upon completion of the book chronicling that experience.Today is that day.This week marks the release of To Shake The Sleeping Self*. It’s everything I hoped it would be. On the surface it captures his epic bicycle expedition in vivid detail. But beyond the literal, it’s an elegant polemic about the search for identity, the cultivation of community, the struggle to find one’s place in the world, and ultimately embrace what it means to be human.An extraordinary storyteller, Jedidiah has an elegant gift for exploring the interior landscape. Unique is his talent for sharing a perspective deeply personal that also unifies, tapping something pure and true within all of us. Today’s exchange — picking up where we left off three years prior (RRP #186) — will leave you both smiling nodding in agreement.This conversation tracks the tense interplay between faith and sexuality. It’s about self-acceptance. And what it means to exit out of entrapment and defy social expectations.We discuss rites of passage. The role travel plays in the quest for personal truth. How adventure compels us to confront and better understand our personal identity in a rapidly changing and often confusing world.But ultimately, this is a conversation about what it means to be eternally teachable.These subjects are ephemeral — I get it. But as you will soon discover, Jedidiah has a brilliant facility for weaving airy concepts into a coherent and compelling narrative that will leave both you wanting more and rushing to buy his new book.Jedidiah is one of my very favorite people. My hope is that this conversation will leave you feeling the same.For the visually inclined you can watch it all go down here > bit.ly/richandjedPeace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

September 23, 2018

“Running is an act of rebellion.”Knox RobinsonWhat is running culture?I suppose the answer depends upon whom you ask. For example, Sanjay Rawal’s perspective will likely vary from that of Shalane Flanagan.If you ask Knox Robinson, his definition will have little to do with splits and podiums — and everything to do with movement as an art form. Running as a means of personal and philosophical expression. The physical voice of literature. Poetry. Music. And Politics.For Knox, running as an act of rebellion — a means to unshackle oneself from pressures and expectations both external and internal. Freedom from the lies others tell us. And liberty from the lies we tell ourselves.This week he explains. You’re not going to want to miss it.Based in New York City, Knox isn’t just a great runner and coach. He isn’t just a great writer. And he isn’t just the co-founder and captain of Black Roses NYC — a diverse & heavily tattooed collective of amateur New York City runners who routinely gather to hammer out intervals through downtown Manhattan then go slurp ramen and spin vinyl.Inhabiting a space in defiance of labels, Knox is the kind of human who, when asked to describe himself, effortlessly pulls the perfect quote from the poetry of Amir Baraka: “[I am] a long-breath singer, would-be dancer, strong from years of fantasy and struggle.”It follows that Knox’s relationship with running also fails easy definition. Despite his father’s passion for local 10K’s, Knox showed little to no athletic promise as a youth. Nonetheless he notched his way up to national caliber at Wake Forest University. Then he walked away from the sport altogether for the better part of a decade. He studied black history, art, literature and poetry. He pursued a career as a spoken word artist. He worked in the music industry managing artists. And he served as editor-in-chief of Fader – the ultimate print destination for all things hip hop, indie music, urban style and culture — jet setting to Fashion Week parties in Paris and penning thoughtful cover pieces on everyone from Kanye to The White Stripes.It was his son’s birth that compelled Knox to dust off his trainers and revisit his connection with athleticism. Expanding his relationship beyond the scope of performance, he began to imagine new horizons for his role in sport. With this epiphany came a new life. And a mission: to leverage movement as an art form — running as physical manifestation of both individual expression and communal cultural identity.This is his story.One of the more intimate, earnest and layered conversations I’ve had in recent memory, I left this exchange better for having had it, thinking more deeply about my own relationship with running, and how I can better impact others. My hope is that it does the same for you.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

September 20, 2018

“Every single moment is a teacher.”Guru SinghWelcome to another edition Guru Corner — a spiritual version of my popular Coach’s Corner series featuring my favorite teacher on all things mystic and metaphysical, Guru Singh.For those new to the show, imagine a modern-day Gandalf who rocks like Hendrix while dropping pearls of wisdom that beautifully fuse Eastern mysticism with Western pragmatism.A celebrated third-generation Sikh yogi, master spiritual teacher, author, and musician, for the past 40 years Guru Singh has been studying and teaching Kundalini Yoga. He is the author of several books, a powerful lecturer and behind-the-scenes guide to many a luminary, including Fortune 500 CEOs, athletes, and artists.A peer of rock legends like Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead, Guru Singh is also a supremely talented musician who began his recording career on Warner Bros’ Reprise label in the 1960s. When he isn’t recording tracks with people like Seal, he’s bringing down the house on the daily at Yoga West, his Los Angeles home base.Over the last couple years, I have grown quite close with Guru Singh, a beautiful and highly relatable consciousness I’m proud to call friend, family and mentor. It’s a privilege to share more of his powerful wisdom with you today.Today’s conversation is an intimate exploration into the depths of our darkest emotions — shame, grief, sadness and depression — and the lessons they hold.We discuss the process of releasing our attachment to ideas and identities that no longer serve us. How to navigate the pressures of our modern existence, embrace tumultuous times, and serve the planet as it serves us.And we mine the truth that all of us — irrespective of circumstance — possess the ability to overcome our circumstances and transcend our perceived limitations.My hope is that this conversation will empower you to more deeply invest in the development of your conscious awareness, personal boundaries, and spiritual growth.Because, to quote Guru Singh, life is not about controlling the outside world, it’s about mastering perceptions from the inside.Note: If you missed our initial conversations, start with episode 267 and then enjoy episodes 332 and 368.Final Note: The visually inclined can watch our entire conversation on YouTube HERE (just make sure to subscribe!)Let the master class resume.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

Did people become happier as history unfolded? What ethical questions do science and technology raise in the 21st century?These are the queries that compel Yuval Noah Harari — a man unafraid to tackle the biggest questions of our time.For those unfamiliar, Yuval is a renown historian who received his PhD from the University of Oxford in 2002 and is currently a lecturer at the Department of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.But Yuval is best known as the author of three groundbreaking, massive bestsellers. Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* is a narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution —a #1 international hit that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” A worldwide sensation recommended by Barack Obama, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, Sapiens has sold over 15 million copies, been translated into nearly 50 languages, was listed on the Sunday Times bestseller list for over six months in paperback, and was a New York Times top 10 bestseller.Whereas Sapiens peered into our past, Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow* tunes Yuval’s perspicuity on his estimation of our species’ future — specifically our quest to upgrade humans into gods. Within two years of publication, the book has sold in excess of four million copies and been translated into nearly 50 languages.Yuval’s latest work is 21 lessons For the 21st Century*, a probing and visionary investigation into today’s most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. Here he stops to take the pulse of our current global climate, focusing on the biggest questions of the present moment: What is really happening right now? What are today’s greatest challenges and choices? And what should we pay attention to?I can’t adequately express the profound extent to which Yuval’s work has impacted my perspective on humanity’s past. The bizarre future that will undoubtedly reshape our species. And the unprecedented predicaments we currently face — acute problems that if not adequately solved will harken the end of humanity as we currently understand it.Yuval’s work is defined by his ability to see things clearly – with a distance and objectivity that provides a welcome and much needed expanse to explore big ideas.It’s a clarity he credits to meditation, a ritual he diligently practices two hours daily with an annual 60 day silent retreat.Today I sit down with one of the world’s great public intellectuals to explore these urgent questions — and what might befall humanity should should we fail to craft solutions — all through the clarity of Yuval’s finely ground lens.We discuss the problem of disinformation and distraction. How artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping our world. The profound implications presented by convergent advances in both biotech and infotech. And why Big Data harkens the end of humanism.We explore the problematic nature of our outdated education system. The importance of professional flexibility in the age of automation. Why clarity is the new superpower. And the practices Yuval relies upon to deploy his prodigious intellectual acumen.I only had a tight hour with Yuval, so I couldn’t probe as deeply as I would have preferred. But nonetheless this conversation is packed with plenty to ponder.It was truly an honor to sit down with one of the great minds of the 21st century. I sincerely hope you enjoy this exchange as much as I enjoyed having it.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

167,Mike Mahler,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/mike-mahler-391/,"Episode 391
September 9, 2018

“Compassion is the most important form of strength.”Mike MahlerWhen we ponder health, we tend to think about things like diet and exercise.Overlooked in this conversation is the primacy of hormone regulation. Chemical messengers that control almost all biological functions — from hunger to mood and everything in between — hormones play a massive role in overall well-being. When properly balanced, we function at our best. But should they fall out of whack, we become susceptible to everything we endeavor to avoid: weight gain, depression, poor energy, impaired sleep and a litany of chronic lifestyle diseases to name just a few.So let’s stop overlooking this critical aspect of wellness.Today’s maestro for all things hormonal is Mike Mahler — a human specimen of strength and power whose personal expertise in hormone optimization was catalyzed by an acute health crisis he struggled mightily to solve.Perhaps best known as one of the leading experts on effective kettlebell training for size, strength, fat loss and conditioning, Mike is a renown strength coach with a specialization in hormone optimization via nutrition, training, supplements, and lifestyle. He is the author of a variety of best-selling kettlebell training e-books and DVDs. He teaches popular kettlebell workshops globally and is a regular contributor to publications like Muscle & Fitness, Men’s Fitness, and Testosterone Magazine (yes, this is actually a thing). And he has been featured in Muscle & Fitness, Men’s Fitness UK, and CBS News.In addition, Mike is the host of the Live Life Aggresively podcast and the author of Live Life Aggressively! What Self-Help Gurus Should Be Telling You*.Refreshing for his raw honesty and no B.S. style, Mike developed a deep interest in hormone health after a serious bout with pneumonia and chronic stress left his immune system debilitated. Solutions to his malady eluded him until he pulled focus on correcting his hormonal imbalances — a journey that provoked a passion for preaching the importance of understanding the crucial role our internal regulators play in order to live truly well and perform at our peak potential.This is conversation about that journey.We nerd out on the specifics, which hormones do what and why, and how regulatory imbalances can lead to everything from obesity to exhaustion.We talk intermittent fasting; effective training techniques; how to avoid over-training; and the importance of restoration, stress reduction and sleep.We cover this interest and role in the growing kettlebell revolution; the importance of functional strength and mobility; and his every-day rituals.We discuss Mike’s interest in combating human trafficking and his support of Project Child Save, a non-profit devoted to locating and recovering children kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery.And we explore his vegan journey, why he doesn’t wear it on his sleeve, the importance of leading by example.But more than anything, this is a conversation about what it means to live live aggressively — and why compassion is the ultimate strength.Chocked full of great information, Mike was awesome. I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange as much as I enjoyed having it.And make sure to break out that pen and paper — you’re going to want to take notes.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Attraction always works better than promotion.”Rich RollThis episode features the audio from a live event I hosted this past summer at Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin with Stephen & David Flynn of The Happy Pear.Long-time listeners will well remember David and Stephen from #RRP 233, one of my most popular episodes of 2016. Since then the lads have made two subsequent appearances on the show in episodes 331 and 380.For those newer to the show, The Happy Pear are the joined-at-the-hip identical twin brothers behind a family run chain of natural food stores and cafés in Ireland as well as a line of organic, locally harvested plant-based food products available across the UK.The face and voice of Ireland’s quickly growing healthy food revolution, the twins are omnipresent on social media and the bestselling authors behind a series of runaway smash-hit plant-based cookbooks, including The Happy Pear* (of course), World of the Happy Pear*, and their most recent release, The Happy Pear: Recipes for Happiness*.Today’s exchange opens with an extended monologue on the power of decisions by your truly. Extends to embrace the innate power we all possess to change and grow. Pivots to the importance of community. And opens up to audience Q&A on everything from healthy eating habits to how best to catalyze change in others.I talk about the power of decisions. The importance of community. And the fact that we are all capable of positive change – and how to be a beacon to catalyze change in others.This event inspired me to host more live experiences. At home and beyond.

September 2, 2018

“Running unites us. At one point, every culture on Earth relied on running. It’s baked into our DNA.”Sanjay RawalMost contemplate running as exercise. A physical practice we reluctantly endure. An uncomfortable discipline we tolerate for the sake of fitness. For weight loss. Or to competitively measure ourselves against ourselves and others.Running is about metrics. Pace maintained. Distance covered. Calories burned. Energy expended. And results quantified.But ask Sanjay Rawal and he’ll tell you that definition isn’t just limited — it misses the point altogether.Running is so much more than podiums and aesthetics. At its core, it’s a most primal activity that unites us all. It’s about growth. It’s about self-understanding. And for many cultures dating back millennia, it’s about spiritual growth. Survival. Healing. And even transcendence.Running as devotion.Today Sanjay and I explore this theme in a riveting conversation focused on the inherent and indelible power of this shared human experience to better understand ourselves, our environment and the unseen world.A graduate of U.C. Berkeley with a B.A. in Molecular & Cell Biology and Neurobiology, Sanjay was on the fast track to a career in medicine when he began to question his path, seeking answers and solace in meditation. This quest led to becoming a devoted student of Sri Chinmoy, an Indian spiritual teacher based in New York. What followed is life committed to spiritual expansion. And a calling to improve the collective human condition.Sanjay spent a decade in human rights philanthropy before realizing he could deepen his impact by turning a lens on cultures and communities worthy of notice. Hence was born a career in documentary filmmaking. Sanjay’s oeuvre includes Ocean Monk*, Challenging Impossibility, and Food Chains*, which takes a hard look at migrant farm labor exploitation.Sanjay’s latest offering, and the focus of today’s conversation, is 3100: Run and Become. A behind-the-scenes immersion into the Sri Chinmoy Self-Transcendence 3100 Mile Race — the world’s most elusive and elite, multi-day running race. Held annually around one utterly unremarkable half-mile urban sidewalk block in Queens, New York, it demands competitors to complete at least 59 miles daily for 52 straight days.The goal? Not glory, but rather the promise of personal expansion and a deeper sense of self.The film also explores the historic and current relationship between running and spirituality through intimate visits with the Marathon Monks of Japan’s Mt. Hiei; the persistence hunters of Africa’s Kalahari tribe; and Arizona’s Navajo Nation.The act of running to transform oneself is as old as time. Ancient man and woman ran not just for survival, but to connect with Nature and the Divine.This is a conversation that explores this essential truth.Because to run is to be human.I sincerely hope you enjoy this very special exchange with a truly remarkable man.

August 26, 2018

“I made it through the things I did because I had ammunition in the form of knowledge, which I could take shelter of in my darkest hours.“John JosephBack by popular demand, my main man and provocateur-at-large John Joseph returns for his 6th appearance on the show to share more of his extraordinary story. A story that lays bare the indelible power of the human spirit to face and transcend unimaginable obstacles and ultimately transform one’s life wholesale.If you’re a longtime listener, Johnny Bloodclot needs no introduction. For the uninitiated, John is a sui generis American original. The very definition of hardcore. A survivor. A spiritual warrior spouting straight talk directly from the streets of the Lower East Side with one singular, driving purpose:getting people to wake the f&*k up.Conceived and raised in abuse, deprived of opportunity and left to his own devices, John turned to violence and drugs on the rough and tumble streets of downtown Manhattan in the 1970’s — during New York’s most violent decade. It’s a path that predictably led to crime, addiction and incarceration. Spending his teens as a drug mule led to a series of unsavory foster care homes, culminating in unimaginably horrific stints in juvenile detention.Then things went downhill. To avoid long-term incarceration, John enlisted in the Navy, only to go AWOL after a fight. Fleeing the law and rudderless, he found redemption in the hardcore punk rock scene flourishing on Manhattan’s Lower East Side in the early 1980’s. Taken in by the Bad Brains’ frontman H.R., John began to explore not just his musicianship, but his spirituality.  It’s a journey that birthed the Cro-Mags – one of the era’s most iconic and influential hardcore punk bands. Later, he found his spiritual salvation living in a Hare Krishna monastery, birthing a life-long love of meditation, yoga, the vegan lifestyle, racing Ironman triathlons, and most importantly, his profound devotion to service.Renown for his straight talk, no BS approach to living, John is the author of Evolution of a Cro-Magnon*; Meat Is For Pussies*; and the upcoming The PMA Effect* — the latter two books each featuring a foreword by your truly — hitting bookstores October 2, 2018 and available for pre-order now here.Today we pick things up where we last left off – a conversation that covers a multitude of subjects, including:Every conversation with John leaves me better than before. Today’s conversation proves that just when I think we’ve covered it all, new layers emerge. So even if you’ve enjoyed all of John’s previous appearances on the podcast, this episode will find you riveted by a stream of mind-blowing, never previously told stories that are certain to incite, provoke, educate and inspire.LANGUAGE ADVISORY: John loves his f-bombs. But I’m not one for muting his authentic voice. So if you’re queasy about foul language, consider yourself warned and make sure the kiddos are out of earshot.Here’s to round 6 with my brother from another mother.To view our conversation on YouTube click here: http://bit.ly/richandjjPeace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

172,Tony Hawk,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/tony-hawk-386/,"Episode 386
August 19, 2018

“My definition of success is doing what you love. I feel many people do things because they feel they have to, and are hesitant to risk following their passion.”Tony HawkTony Hawk was age 9 when his older brother gave him a blue fiberglass skateboard, chipped and scratched from years of use. The first time Tony stepped on it and rolled down an alley behind the family’s house in San Diego, there was no epiphany, no revelation, no foreshadowing whatsoever that he would go on to become the most famous skateboarder of all time. He reached the end driveway, looked back at his brother and shouted, “How do I turn?”The yarn is both sweet and innocent. But it’s also deeply illustrative of the mindset — a unique melding of childlike wonder and unrelenting workmanship — that still drives the single most recognized and influential skateboarder of all time:Keep moving forward. Always be learning. Do what you love. And the rest will follow.The tale of The Birdman is legend. Icon status. A billion dollar video game franchise. A litany of successful brands. A family man and philanthropist. But the story behind Tony Hawk is hardly linear. And it’s a legacy that — at 50 — he continues to build with the unabating persistence that drove his early success.There’s no magic formula behind this man’s triumphs. To be sure, he possesses talent — perhaps an unworldly one at that. But countless gifted athletes come and go. Rare and unique is the individual that can maintain a prominence measured not in years, but decades.Tony’s long-term success in sport, business and life — through times both thick and thin —  can be credited not to any shortcuts or life hacks, but rather to his unyielding devotion to a handful of tried-and-true, back-to-basics principles.Humility. Service. An indefatigable devotion to incremental progress. The courage to constantly take risks. The daring to continually live outside his comfort zone. The willingness to shoulder an unbelievable amount of hard work. And above all, a resolve to always, always do what he loves — because for Tony, life has always been about process over results and rewards.
Let’s face it. The Birdman has been interviewed a million times. He didn’t need to do my show. He doesn’t have a new book out or any specific project he needs my help promote. Nonetheless, he drove several hours from San Diego for no reason other than to openly share his wisdom and experience  — a simple act that speaks loudly to this man’s humble character and dogged work ethic.In other words, Tony isn’t slowing down. Just like that 9-year old trying to master his first turn, this is a man still looking forward to his next move. Expressing himself. Innovating. And curious about the world.It’s an honor to share his story.Of course, we cover his career. And I did my best, as a fellow athlete of his age, to explore how he thinks about being 50; how he balances life as an athlete, businessman and parent; and how he continues to iterate and grow in sport, business and life.But below the surface, this is a conversation about the importance of uncovering and ultimately expressing who you really are. And it’s about the joy and freedom brought about manifesting your most authentic self.Note: the full episode (plus a few short clips publishing later this week) is available in vivid technicolor on YouTube here: bit.ly/richandtony If you are digging the podcast (and my other short movies) on YouTube, it would mean a lot if you subscribed to my channel here: youtube.com/richrollEnjoy the episode!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

August 12, 2018

“It’s always about hard work. It’s always about the diet. It’s always about sacrifice and effort.”Nimai DelgadoBut where do you get your protein?I get this question a lot. Today’s guest probably gets it more than anyone on Earth.A sweetheart of a guy rocking one of the world’s most impressive physiques, this week’s guest is an IFBB Professional Men’s Physique bodybuilder with a most unexpected twist:Nimai Delgado has never eaten meat in his entire life. Not one bite.Raised vegetarian since birth, Nimai switched to a 100% plant based unprocessed diet in 2015, motivated by a desire to live the healthiest lifestyle possible. Not long after, his bodybuilding career skyrocketed. Proving animal products unnecessary for peak fitness, Nimai is indisputable living testimony that you can indeed build tremendous strength and muscle mass without the meat and dairy products most of us have been told our whole lives are critical for health and absolutely mandatory athletic performance.Nimai’s evolution into bodybuilding began as a personal mission to make friends, get fit and stay healthy. Success came swiftly. Within a year, he had won several contests, including the NPC USA Championships, earning him a spot among the IFBB professional ranks.A fresh new face making serious waves on the vegan athlete scene, Nimai has recently shifted focus from self to service — leveraging his rapidly growing profile into a global movement to teach people young and old how to gain muscle, get fit, be competitive and thrive long-term on a plant-based diet.Nimai’s impressive vegan gains have graced the cover of Muscle & Fitness magazine and feature prominently in the hotly anticipated Gamechangers documentary. When he isn’t killing it in the gym, he’s hosting the recently launched Generation V podcast and sharing daily diet and fitness tips with his 265K Instagram followers.Perhaps you follow him on social media. Maybe you’ve seen him flexing in magazines. But there’s so much more to Nimai than bulging biceps.Today we unpack the untold story.This is a conversation about what it was like being raised by Hare Krisha devotee parents who immigrated from Argentina. It’s an open account of his experience growing up on a commune in rural south Mississippi. It’s an exchange about how the bodybuilding subculture captured his interest. And it’s about why he made the choice to go and stay vegan.Of course, we cover his training routines. We discuss his daily nutritional regimen. Yes, we talk protein — where he gets it and the misconceptions behind the hotly debated macro-nutrient. And because suspicion is unavoidable, I do ask him about steroids.But most of all, this is an exploration of the lesser known Nimai — the spiritual and ethical foundation beneath what he does, how he does it, and most importantly why.It was an honor to have this awesome human in the studio. It’s my pleasure to share his wisdom with you today. And my hope is that our exchange will leave you not only inspired, but questioning more than a few long-held assumptions about the role of nutrition in athletic performance.To get a gander of this physical specimen, watch our entire conversation on YouTube at bit.ly/richandnimaiSign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

175,Bassem Youssef,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/bassem-youssef-383/,"Episode 383
August 5, 2018

“Hate is illogical and hating other human beings is something that is outside of our nature”Bassem YoussefOne minute you’re a heart surgeon. Blink once and you’re hosting the most watched television program in Middle East history. Blink again and you’re exiled from the homeland that made you famous.The story of Bassem Youssef is legend. But there’s far more to this tale than meets the eye.Dubbed the Jon Stewart of the Arab World, today’s guest is an Egyptian cardiothoracic surgeon and member of the Royal College of Surgeons who caught lightning in a bottle making catchy 5-minute YouTube videos in his Cairo laundry room. A flash moment later, he’s a media mega-star, the man behind a controversial, first-of-it’s-kind political satire program entitled Al-Bernameg that garnered a massive and unprecedented 30 million viewers every week.Insightful as it was incisive, Al-Bernameg received global acclaim and coverage in some of the world’s biggest media outlets, culminating in Bassem appearing on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart – twice. But Bassem’s bold criticism of the ruling powers led to accusations that he was disrupting public order, insulting Islam and its Armed Forces. Over 120 complaints were lodged with the General Prosecutor’s office. Tens of lawsuits were filed. He was publicly smeared. Opponents put his theatre under seige, even jamming his satellite signal during airing.Then came the arrest — a detainment that brought Bassem to the realization that his media career in Eqypt had come to a swift and decisive end, culminating in Bassem fleeing his homeland for the United States.Nonetheless, Bassem’s work made an indelible imprint on Middle East culture. He landed on TIME magazine’s annual 100 Most Influential People list. He was awarded the International Press Freedom Award by the CPJ and chosen by Foreign Policy magazine as one of the global thinkers.The focus of the acclaimed documentary Tickling Giants, Bassem is the author of Revolution for Dummies: Laughing Through the Arab Spring*. And when he isn’t developing television projects or performing stand up comedy, he hosts a recently launched podcast entitled Remade In America.But Bassem’s latest act could be his most impactful to date: the quest to revolutionize nutrition and health across the Middle East.As passionate about the plant-based lifestyle as he is about political satire, Bassem is on an unlikely yet zealous quest to leverage his medical background and massive influence across the Middle East (10+ million twitter followers!) to better educate the region on the inextricable connection between nutrition, illness and optimal health.This is a powerful conversation about how one doctor became a lightning rod media figure in the cross hairs of political power and social unrest.It’s about fake news, free speech and the cultural imperative of political satire in responsible citizenship.And it’s a discourse on how this man’s personal evolution and relationship with food motivated a desire to redress the chronic lifestyle illness epidemic America has exported across the Middle East.Note: we conducted this interview at Bassem’s apartment in the midst of a crazy LA heatwave that left my studio with a power outage. Therefore we did not capture this episode on video and apologies if the sound quality isn’t entirely up to par. However, it was live-streamed to Bassem’s Facebook page (hence his questions for me near the end for his audience).

“I want people to consume the greatest foods in the world so they can can actually thrive and have the energy to kick ass and live the dream life they want.”Darin OlienWhat’s it like to explore the planet’s hidden corners treasure hunting for the world’s greatest edible food sources?Meet the Superman of Superfoods.One of my most popular guests, Darin Olien (@superlifeliving) returns for his third appearance on the podcast to delve deep on next level nutrition insights gleaned from his extraordinary adventures as a renown exotic superfoods hunter, wellness advocate, supplement formulator & ardent environmental activist.Over the last twenty plus years, Darin has reconnoitered secluded pockets across the Americas, South Pacific and Asia questing for better, more natural pathways to ultimate wellness. After communing with thousands of rural farmers across the developing world, Darin has arrived upon his latest superfood obsession: the baru nut — an exotic incredibly nutrient rich superfood known to the indigenous tribes of the Brazilian Cerrado for millennia, yet virtually unheard of anywhere else.Crazy delicious bordering on addictive, the Barùkas (derived from the Baruzieta tree and commonly referred to as “baru”) tastes like a mashup of almond, cashew and peanut, but better. Not only does it boast an insane nutritional profile packed with micronutrients (loaded with magnesium), fiber (more than any other nut) and protein (6g with all essential amino acids), it’s also lower in calories (25% fewer fat calories than other nuts) and requires far less water and input resources to produce.Darin’s discovery led to an epiphany that he could help preserve the Cerrado (a tropical savanna ecoregion three times the size of Texas) against the current and very real threat of cattle industry deforestation by employing its indigenous communities to harvest the native baru and importing them to North America — a win win to preserve precious environmental resources and simultaneously introduce the developed world to the healthiest nut on the planet.Thus was born Barùkas.Today he tells the story.This conversation is a literal superfood show and tell (don’t miss it on YouTube). It’s a tutorial on the underappreciated Brazilian Cerrado. It’s a look at the hows and whys behind his new company, Barùkas. And it’s an advanced placement course on the importance of breath, brain states and finding life purpose.An inspiration to me personally, Darin is a guy who walks his talk. From the foods he consumes to the lifestyle habits he practices, he is the thriving embodiment of what it means to truly own and take responsibility for your health, your life and the planet we collectively enjoy.For the visually inclined, you can watch the full conversation on YouTube at bit.ly/darinandrichFinal Note: In the interest of total transparency and because I believe wholeheartedly in Darin’s mission, I have become a Barùkas ambassador. So if today’s conversation left you interested in checking out the baru nut and supporting the show, Darin has a special offer for my listeners. Visit barukas.com/richroll or enter coupon code RICHROLL at checkout and receive 15% off your first purchase (coupon code required for subscriptions even when using the special URL). Your patronage will benefit the podcast and also let Darin know that you heard about Barùkas here first.

Packed with giveaways and incentives (including a superfood hunting trip with Darin), it’s also a great way to be the first to enjoy their new trail mix product.I love this conversation.

July 22, 2018

“The brain is a pliable instrument. If you don’t program it, someone else will.”Brian RoseThis week I explore the story of a extremely smart, capable and disciplined man who lost his way in the pursuit of the American Dream. It’s a quest that left him disillusioned. Broken and lost, it was only when he let go of that dream entirely that he ultimately found himself and the purpose and fulfillment that had always eluded him.Meet Brian Rose.San Diego born and bred, Brian earned a mechanical engineering degree from MIT and his MBA from the Sloan School of Management before heading to Wall Street to make a name for himself.With money came the fast-paced investment banker lifestyle that accompanies newfound riches. A hard-partying culture in which more was never enough. A warped sense of entitlement that led to financial success. And a perverted belief in his own invincibility that debased his sense of self and led to a heroin addiction that very nearly claimed his life.Professionally, emotionally and spiritually bankrupt, Brian was compelled to face his addiction and the existential crisis that provoked it — an epiphany in which he realized he could no longer continue along the path he had chosen for himself. He hated his work. He hated his life. And he hated himself.Thus began Brian’s journey to reclaim his life. A search for meaning. A path towards purpose. And a quest towards becoming whole.He only had to change one thing: everything.Walking away away from his lucrative banking career, Brian reinvents himself entirely — physically, mentally, spiritually and professionally. Without any experience, he embarks on a new self-styled career as the host of London Real, an intimate, high-gloss new media talk show launched in 2011 as an alternative to conventional media.The show is marked by humble beginnings, but ultimately it becomes a massive success. Over the last seven years, Brian has sat for intimate, in-depth conversations with some of the greatest minds on the planet, amassing over 100 million views along the way.An avid fan of London Real from the outset, I credit Brian as an inspiration for this show. But it wasn’t until this past year that my interest in meeting him quickened.Seven months ago my friend (and podcast favorite) John Joseph guested on London Real, challenging Brian Brian to tackle a half-ironman on a plant-based diet. Not only did Brian accept the challenge, he created a YouTube mini-series entitled Ironmind — a documentation of the mindset and preparation required to step outside one’s comfort zone. I loved it for the raw honesty in which Brian confronts his past: the shame of his heroin addiction; his history of misplaced priorities; and the spiritual epiphanies that led to his rebirth.Although the facts of our respective stories differ, I deeply related to Brian’s emotional journey. And I knew I needed to get him on the show.This is Brian’s story. It’s a story about one dynamic man’s quest to live and be better. It’s a conversation about a capsized American Dream. It’s about the search for happiness, fulfillment, contentedness and purpose. How these things we seek most simply cannot be found in the material. And why the path forward is achieved only through an elevation of consciousness.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Final note: Brian graciously allowed me to use his studio and team to produce both the audio and video for this episode.

July 19, 2018

“If you’re happy with really simple things, it’s a lot easier to find joy every day.”The Happy PearConducted live during our recent Plantpower Italia retreat, this special mid-week edition of the podcast features my third conversation with Stephen & David Flynn.Longtime listeners are well-acquainted with these Irish laddies. Stephen and David first appeared on the show back in June 2016 (#RRP 233) and again in November 2017 (RRP #331), a conversation captured before a live audience at Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin.For those newer to the show, David and Stephen are the joined-at-the-hip identical twin brothers behind The Happy Pear, a family run chain of natural food stores and cafés in Ireland as well as a robust line of organic, locally harvested plant-based food products available across the UK.The face and voice of Ireland’s quickly growing healthy food revolution, the twins are omnipresent on social media and the bestselling authors behind a series of runaway smash-hit plant-based cookbooks, including The Happy Pear* (of course), World of the Happy Pear*, and their most recent release, The Happy Pear: Recipes for Happiness*.The Happy Pear isn’t just two energetic twin brothers. It isn’t just a series of cafés, cookbooks and food products. It’s a movement. A movement rooted in family and community with one singular goal — to make healthy food and lifestyle mainstream. When the super fit dads aren’t making pre-school breakfast picnics on the beach, engaging in impromptu handstand competitions, conducting community-oriented health education courses or traveling extensively for public speaking, they enthusiastically guide a vast and devoted global audience of wellness warriors across every social media platform from YouTube to Instagram with an endless stream of highly entertaining, quality nutrition and fitness tips, recipes and daily slice-of-life vlogs with inspiration for miles.Picking up where our last conversation left off, please enjoy my exchange with two of the most charismatic and emphatic advocates for healthy living I have ever met.Final Note: During my recent visit to Dublin a few weeks ago, I co-hosted another live event at Smock Alley Theatre with the boys. So if you enjoy their company, you can look forward to that conversation & audience Q&A, which I will be sharing here in the coming months.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

179,John McAvoy,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/john-mcavoy-379/,"Episode 379
July 15, 2018

“I’ve nearly been shot dead by the police – twice. I’ve been to court and handed a life sentence at 24 years old. I’ve been around some of the most dangerous men in the country, actual psychopaths… When I race, I feel tremendously honored that I can compete.”John McAvoyI can say without equivocation John McAvoy’s story of metamorphosis is one of the most compelling, improbable, inspirational, and cinematic tales I have ever heard.Born into a notorious London crime family — think The Sopranos meets The Krays — John is a former high profile armed robber who bought his first gun at 16 and quickly became one of Britain’s most successful career criminals and most-wanted men. But it took two spells in prison and a close friend’s death amidst a heist gone awry to birth a desire to change — redemption he ultimately discovered through the transformative power of sport.Pulling one of the most improbable 180-degree life transformations of all time, John’s greatest heist isn’t a bank — it’s his life.While serving a double life sentence on the Belmarsh high security wing — space he shared with extremist cleric Abu Hamza and the 7/7 bombers — John decided to take a spin on the prison gym’s indoor rowing machine. That experience revealed a unmistakable fact — John’s freakish natural aptitude for endurance matched only by an inhuman ability to suffer.The epiphany was miraculous. And it would change his life forever.In short shrift, John broke a cluster of British and World indoor rowing records while in prison. Upon parole, he began forging a new life as a professional endurance athlete. Today, John is the world’s only Nike sponsored Ironman athlete, a stalwart mouthpiece for prison reform and a staunch advocate for the inherent power we all possess to course correct the trajectory of one’s life, no matter how dire the circumstances.If John’s story doesn’t inspire you to be better, then you might want to check yourself for a heartbeat. In all honesty, I cant remember being so excited about sharing a podcast conversation. I sincerely hope the exchange inspires you to rethink your potential and the physical, mental and emotional limits you impose upon your inherent ability to live the life you desire.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

July 8, 2018

“Wake up every morning empowered by where you’ve been and encouraged by the curiosity, possibility and wonderlust of where you’re about to go.”Eduardo GarciaImagine yourself alone in the Montana backcountry. You’re doing what you love — camping, hiking and simply enjoying the wilderness — when you stumble upon a rusted old relic. An old oil drum perhaps. Curious, you approach and peer inside to discover the remnants of a long-dead black bear cub. You set down your backpack and reach inside to further investigate.What happened next would forever alter the life of this week’s guest – a flash of electricity so intense it should have instantly killed this young man of 30. 2400 volts that seared his insides, utterly destroyed his left arm, left his body with 9 severe exit wounds and delivered him to the ICU little more than a dead man with a heartbeat.Eduardo Garcia would spend 48 days in intensive care. He would undergo 21 surgeries that would claim four ribs, a ton of muscle mass, and even his left arm. On top of everything else, he would be diagnosed with testicular cancer.But against all odds, Eduardo survived.A chef by trade, Eduardo began his career at 15 before attending culinary school. He spent the next decade traveling the world cooking for various high-end people on various high-end yachts. In 2011, he decided to return home to Montana to start Montana Mex, a food company that today produces a line of fine organic & non-GMO sauces and seasonings.But the tragic accident that would soon befall Eduardo would ultimately set his life on a new and unforeseen trajectory beyond his wildest imagination.Dubbed the Bionic Chef, I first came across Eduardo’s story by way of Charged*, a feature-length documentary that elegantly chronicles the spirit of what this man lost but more importantly, what he found. It’s a survival story built on the foundations of love and forgiveness. It’s about building stronger relationships and a better life after tragedy. And it’s about finding your best self so you can live life fully charged.Today I have the great privilege of sharing Eduardo’s incredible story. It’s an inspirational tale of facing and overcoming extraordinary adversity. And it’s about the power of attitude to persevere.But more than anything, it’s about one man’s journey to wholeness — and ultimately, redemption.For the visually inclined, you can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/richandeduardoI sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I enjoyed having it.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

July 5, 2018

“An athlete is a mindset. It’s how you prepare, think and execute. Not because of some elite status or physical stature. Anybody can be an athlete.”Chris HauthToday I am once again joined by 2-time Olympian Chris Hauth for another edition of Coach’s Corner – a spin on my typical podcast format where I go deep and get granular on the physical, mental and emotional aspects of high performance for both sport and life.A sub-9 hour Ironman, Chris (@AIMPCoach) is an Age Group Ironman World Champion, a former 2-time Olympic Swimmer, and one of the world’s most respected endurance coaches. In 2006, Chris won the Ironman Coeur D’Alene and went on to be the first American amateur & 4th overall American at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii.When he’s not training and racing, Chris hosts the Weekly Word Podcast and runs AIMP Coaching, mentoring a wide spectrum of athletes ranging from elite professionals — including Ironman and Western States top finishers, Ultraman winners and Olympic Trials qualifiers — to first time half-marathoners.Whether you are an elite athlete or just starting out, Chris knows how to get the best out of athletes the right way. A long-time friend and mentor as much as a coach, I have been under Chris’ tutelage since 2008, during which time he deftly guided me through three Ultraman World Championships (’08, ’09 & ’11), EPIC5 in 2010 and the Ötillö Swimrun World Championships in 2017, an event we raced together as a team.I could have never achieved the level of athletic success I have enjoyed without Chris’ deft counsel, so it is with pleasure that I share more of his wisdom with you today.This is a conversation and audience Q&A that explores what it means to adopt the athlete mindset. It’s about the differences between intentional training versus simply exercising. And it’s about the key practices that — when performed consistently — most influence success in both sport and life.But most of all, this is a discourse about why anyone can be an athlete — a state of mind and action that has nothing to with elite status or genetic gifts and everything to do with your relationship with yourself and how you navigate the world at large.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.For the visually inclined, you can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: bit.ly/coachscorner377Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

182,Rangan Chatterjee MD,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rangan-chatterjee-376/,"Episode 376
July 1, 2018

“Getting people better doesn’t come from scientific papers. It’s about creating actionable information.”Rangan Chatterjee MDThe developed world is mired in a cataclysmic epidemic of chronic lifestyle illness. Heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, depression and dementia — the current leading causes of death and disability — are modern day plagues, killing untold millions annually.Quite shockingly, a full one-half of all American adults currently suffer from one of these diseases, with one in four suffering from two or more.Nonetheless, confusion persists when it comes to what can be done to protect ourselves and ultimately lead the long healthy lives we deserve.Most commonly overlooked in this discussion is the incredible power of our daily diet and lifestyle choices. Choices that when made right can prevent, treat and often even reverse these and many other debilitating chronic ailments.Today I explore this terrain — a common, recurring theme of this podcast — with Dr. Rangan Chatterjee, a pioneer in the field of progressive medicine.Regarded as one of the most influential doctors in the UK, Dr. Chatterjee is double board certified in internal medicine and family medicine and holds an honors degree in immunology. An in-demand lecturer, he created the very first “Prescribing Lifestyle Medicine” course accredited by the Royal College of General Practitioners in London, and is the star of the BBC One television show, Doctor In The House where he uses a functional and lifestyle medicine approach to reverse chronic disease.Dr. Chatterjee is also the author of The Four Pillar Plan*, an instant UK Sunday Times best-seller recently released in the United States under the title How To Make Disease Disappear*. He has been extensively profiled in a litany of major media outlets. He hosts the popular Feel Better, Live More podcast (which I will be appearing on soon). And he is a regular contributor to BBC Radio and the HuffPost.Similar to my recent conversation with Dr. Frank Lipman, this is a conversation about the current state of health and lifestyle disease in the modern, developed world.It’s about Dr. Chatterjee’s personal course correct — the motivational why behind his decision to segue from a traditional medical practice to the emerging world of functional medicine.And it’s a primer on the crucial role of diet, nutrition, movement, sleep and stress reduction when it comes to health, longevity and disease prevention.As an interesting aside, Rangan is also quite the musician. He even once took a career sabbatical to tour with his band. I was able to talk him into an impromptu performance at the end of the show. So be sure to stick around to the end for his acoustic rendition of The Eagles’ Take It Easy – it’s pretty great.For the visually inclined, you can watch our entire conversation on YouTube here: http://bit.ly/richandranganI sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

June 24, 2018

“Some days it just flows and I feel like I’m born to do this, other days it feels like I’m trudging through hell. Every day I make the choice to show up and see what I’ve got, and to try and be better. My advice: keep showing up.”Des LindenOn April 16, 2018, Des Linden captured the hearts of millions the world over by becoming the first American female in 33 years to win the prestigious Boston Marathon.It wasn’t just that she won.It’s how she won.You see, this wasn’t supposed to be Des’ year. It wasn’t supposed to be Des’ race. Her preparation wasn’t ideal. She didn’t feel great. And doubt crept in. On top of everything, the weather conditions were unprecedented. So Des Linden decided to do what nobody does — sacrifice herself and her personal performance for the benefit of her friends. She famously pulled up when Shalane Flanagan detoured to the porta potty to pace her back to the group. Then selflessly repeated the gesture to help Molly Huddle bridge a separation gap.These are not things you do when you are in it to win it.But Des Linden is no ordinary athlete. And this was no ordinary race. At mile 22, Des surged out of nowhere, impossibly depositing her into the lead. In the biggest race of her life — on a day when Mother Nature and her icy rains and 25mph headwinds proved the biggest antagonist — she finally claimed the precious victory that had always previously eluded her.Today the 2-time Olympian shares her story.How she did it. What got her there. What it all means. And what’s next.This is a conversation with Des and her long-time manager Josh Cox — the U.S. 50K record holder and former elite marathoner in his own right — about a storied athletic career that until now lacked just one thing: a major marathon victory.It’s about what this particular victory means not just to Des, but to American women’s marathoning and running in general.It’s about the mindset that propelled her career to this historic moment.It’s about leveraging past failures as an opportunity to grow — because failure is simply an action, not an identity.But more than anything, this is a conversation about the power of showing up. Because when you simply keep showing up for that which you love, you make room for the miracle.Applicable in running.

June 17, 2018

“I don’t have the muscle of self-pity.”Utkarsh AmbudkarOne day you get a call from your friend Lin-Manuel Miranda.“I’ve got this thing I’m working on,” he says. “Are you interested?”Without thought or question, Utkarsh Ambudkar jumps at the opportunity.That ‘thing’ happened to be a little play you might have heard of called Hamilton.And the part wasn’t just any part. It was the leading turn as Aaron Burr — a role Utkarsh originated on-stage at Lincoln Center.Unfortunately, the stage lights on Utkarsh would soon dim. Dedication was foiled by ego. Partying took precedence over the work. In a word, he just couldn’t seem to get out of his own way. And so before Hamilton even really became HAMILTON, Lin was compelled to let Utkarsh go.This role of a lifetime, it seemed, would not be Utkarsh’s to claim after all.It’s a turn of events that ultimately brought Utkarsh to his knees. Perhaps for the very first time, he was forced to reckon with himself honestly — one important link in a chain of events that would eventually lead Utkarsh to a singular, profound realization that would indelibly change his life forever: he had to change. Not just one thing, but everything.An actor, musician, rapper and NYU Tisch School of The Arts graduate, Utkarsh is best known for his standout performances in movies like Pitch Perfect, Barbershop, Million Dollar Arm and Basmati Blues as well as television shows like The Mindy Project and White Famous. One of many South Asian actors making a recent but undeniable stamp on Hollywood, Utkarsh’s latest movie is Blindspotting, a powerful new film starring Hamilton’s Daveed Diggs that rocked audiences at Sundance this past winter and will be screening in select U.S. cities starting July 20.When he isn’t in front of the camera, Utkarsh can be found on stage with his friends as part of Freestyle Love Supreme, the hip hop improv crew that includes none other than Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda himself, or making music — check out his EP Bang Bang and his ‘hauntingly beautiful’ cover rendition of The Proclaimers’ 500 Miles.Perhaps his biggest opportunity to date, Utkarsh recently decamped for a six-month stint in New Zealand where he is working on the Disney big-budget, live-action production of Mulan.Beyond his formidable performative gifts, Utkarsh has an infectious enthusiasm for life. A friend for several years, I have to come to really love this young man. It’s been a privilege to observe him mature into his talent, take ownership of his life, and share his huge heart and what he has learned for the benefit of others.Today he shares his story.This is a conversation about what it means to cultivate a creative life. It’s about confronting Hollywood stereotypes. And it’s a frank exchange about battling and overcoming an addiction that nearly destroyed a young life and a promising career before it barely even began.Raw and unedited, Utkarsh’s tale is powerful, certain to both move and inspire.My hope is that you see in him what I see — the power of true sobriety to shape a person into that which they were always meant to be.So together, let’s celebrate the life of Utkarsh Ambudkar.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

June 10, 2018

“The more we understand the deadly impact of stress, the more we’re looking at alternatives to just a pill.”Bob RothLong-time listeners know well that meditation is a recurring topic of exploration on this podcast. Today I continue this tradition with a man who has played a very large role in pioneering meditation, specifically the practice of Transcendental Meditation (“TM”) throughout the West.Meet meditation legend Bob Roth.Bob first discovered meditation as a freshman at Berkeley during the height of the 1960’s – ground-zero for the anti-war movement and the many cultural changes that were sweeping the country at that time. Once a skeptic, he was soon hooked, ultimately training under the tutelage of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the legendary albeit controversial meditation guru made globally famous by the Beatles. Every day since, he has meditated twice a day every day, devoting his life over the last 45 years to teaching what he has learned to millions of people across the world.Today, Bob is one of the most experienced and sought after meditation teachers in America. A proper meditation teacher to the stars, his student roster includes such recognizable names as Oprah, Russell Brand, Jim Carrey, Jerry Seinfeld, Martin Scorcese, Ray Dalio, Howard Stern, Tom Hanks, Hugh Jackman, and countless other notables.But Bob would much rather talk about his work as the executive director of The David Lynch Foundation, where he has helped bring TM to more than 500,000 inner-city youth in underserved schools in 35 countries, as well as to veterans and their families suffering from PTSD, and women and girls who are survivors of domestic violence.Bob is also the national director of the Center For Leadership Performance, another non-profit which introduces meditation to Fortune 100 companies, government organizations and non-profit charities. And he has spoken about meditation to industry leaders at such gatherings as Google Zeitgeist, Aspen Ideas Festival, Wisdom2.0, and Summit.In addition, Bob penned the authoritative text on the subject of TM, a book aptly titled Transcendental Meditation, and recently released his newest book, Strength in Stillness* – an accessible meditation primer that breaks down the science behind TM and provides a simple, straightforward roadmap for reducing stress, accessing inner power and building resilience.As you might expect, this conversation is a 360-degree primer on everything meditation.We delve into Bob’s introduction to meditation as a young Berkeley student as well as his experience training under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.We discuss how TM differs from other types of meditation.We talk about his work with the David Lynch Foundation, as well as his personal experience with the quirky, brilliant film director himself.And we cover the many scientific benefits of meditation, including how and why a consistent practice can transform your life by reducing stress and anxiety while simultaneously improving everything from focus, concentration, sleep, creativity, acuity, and productivity to emotional and physical resilience.But most of all, this conversation redresses the excuses that prevent you from meditating while empowering you with the tools and inspiration to finally begin a practice and make it stick.A bit briefer than my typical chats due to Bob’s hectic schedule at the time (we recorded this some months back), don’t be fooled by it’s brevity — it’s packed with gems.It was a great honor to spend an hour with Bob. I hope you enjoy the exchange as much as I enjoyed having it.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Life, business, success . . . it’s just like a nightclub. There are always three ways in.”Alex BanayanThe day before his freshman year final exams, 18-year old Alex Banayan hacked The Price Is Right, won a sailboat, sold it, and used the prize money to fund his quest to learn from the worldʼs most successful people.Over the next seven years, he pursued a graduate degree in persistence and perseverance from the University of Life. He snuck into Warren Buffett’s shareholders meeting. He chased Larry King through a grocery store. He celebrated with Lady Gaga in the hottest nightclub. Along the way, he landed remarkable one-on-one interviews with Bill Gates, Maya Angelou, Steve Wozniak, Jane Goodall, Quincy Jones, and many more.Alex’s major discovery? Each and every icon shared one thing in common: they all took something he calls The Third Door*.Since that fateful day on the Price Is Right, Alex went on to become the world’s youngest venture capital executive, a coup that landed him on Forbesʼ ’30 Under 30′ list and Business Insiderʼs ‘Most Powerful People Under 30.’He has delivered keynotes at prestigious organizations like Apple, Nike, IBM, Dell, MTV and even Harvard.He has contributed to publications like Fast Company, the Washington Post, Entrepreneur, and TechCrunch. And he has been featured everywhere from Fortune, Forbes, Businessweek and Bloomberg to Fox News, & CBS News.This week, Alex’s new book chronicling his wild seven-year adventure — aptly entitled The Third Door* — hit bookstores everywhere.I first met Alex about 6 years ago. Just 19 at the time, he was in the very early stages of putting his book together. I liked him instantly, and left our lunch impressed with his rare mix of precociousness, infectious enthusiasm and raw authenticity. We stayed in touch. And that day I made him a promise: should he ever finish his book (something I doubted at the time) that he had an open invite to share his story on the podcast.Today I honor that promise.This is a conversation about one young man’s determination to find his way in the world.It’s about a quest to learn what cannot be taught in the confines of a classroom.It’s about never giving up.And it’s about always finding a way.But most of all, this is a very personal exchange between two friends about what it really means to pursue a dream.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Make your default mode one of generosity. It’s a nice way to live, and it’s contagious.”Frank Lipman MDHealth isn’t the absence of disease. It’s a total state of physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and social wellbeing.Frank Lipman, MD gets it. And today’s conversation reflects this very ethos.A leading trailblazer in Functional and Integrative Medicine, Frank began his training in his native South Africa. Disillusioned with the limitations of conventional medicine, he then spent 18 months working at clinics in the bush. Introduced to local traditional healers (sangomas) kindled an interest in non-traditional healing modalities, catalyzing a passion for combining the best of Western medicine with age-old Eastern techniques of healing, including acupuncture, Chinese medicine, herbal medicine, meditation, and yoga.Today Frank treats patients holistically as the founder and director of Eleven Eleven Wellness Center in New York City. In addition, he is a New York Times best-selling author of six books: Total Renewal*, Revive*, The New Health Rules*, 10 Reasons You Feel Old and Get Fat* and Young and Slim for Life*.His newest book is entitled How To Be Well*, a beautifully illustrated primer on improving and strengthening your resilience, functioning, and overall health.This conversation expands the aperture on what is required to live truly well. It’s about understanding food as the very building blocks of life. It’s about the primacy of sleep and movement. It’s about how to mitigate and prevent the invisible assaults of everyday toxins. It’s about the importance of carving out time to unwind and reboot. And it’s about our innate need to connect with each other in order to awaken and enhance a sense of belonging and meaningBut most of all, this is a conversation about the power we all have to take better control over the quality of our health and lives.One caveat: Frank is not vegan or plant-based. Let’s just say we don’t exactly see eye to eye on everything. But we are great friends who extend a mutual respect for each other. We agree on the majority of things that contribute to wellness and disease. And we enjoy poking fun at each other over our differences.If we want to advance the conversation on the future of health, there is something to be said for building bridges. I offer this conversation in the spirit of that sentiment.Frank is delightful. I found this conversation both enjoyable and informative.

May 27, 2018

“I think a lot of people look at ‘happiness’ as a decision and I look at it as how I choose to live my life — doing things that make me happy with the people that make me happy.”Jesse ItzlerIt’s easy to take risks when your back is against the wall.But it’s the rare individual that will continue to push the envelope, face fear and embrace the unknown when that person could choose to live without self-imposed obstacles.Jesse Itzler is one such human.After a barnburner appearance on the podcast back in 2015 (check RRP #197 if you missed it), the man who lives so far “out of the box” that there is no box returns for another stellar exchange that does not disappoint.For those new to the show, this is a guy who fast-talked his way right out of college into a recording contract, ultimately taking his music all the way to MTV, the Billboard 100 and even an Emmy.Jesse then takes a wild entrepreneurial left-turn, creating and ultimately selling big companies like Marquis Jet, the world’s largest prepaid private jet card company, and Zico Coconut Water, before wooing Spanx founder (and Shark Tank guest host) Sarah Blakely all the way to the altar.Despite his tremendous success as a serial entrepreneur, Jesse started to feel his life stagnate. Desperate to avoid the malaise of risk adversity visited upon many a prosperous peer, he embarks on a hare-brained scheme to invite adventure back into his life by convincing Navy SEAL David Goggins — the most popular episode in the history of this show — to move in with him. David relents on one condition: that Jesse comply with David’s every demand, no matter how severe. The insanity that ensues is hilariously chronicled in Living With A SEAL, Jesse’s well deserved New York Times bestseller.He eats only fruit before noon. He runs 100 mile races. He raises millions for charity. And when he isn’t playing super dad to his four kids (check his Instagram stories for daily dad episodes), he’s an in demand motivational speaker (check out his TEDx Talk) who just happens to own the Atlanta Hawks NBA franchise with a few friends. No biggie.So the question is: how does this guy have such an extraordinary life?Jesse boils it down to one singular mission statement:Live life full blast. Never be afraid to fail. And never, ever allow yourself to stagnate.In an effort to cultivate community around this ethos, Jesse recently launched Made of Challenges, a series of totally unique, end-to-end weekend experiences that are one part wellness retreat (complete with glamping tents and world-class speakers), one part next-level athletic challenge. Come August is Made of Denali, which entails jogging, hiking or crawling up a mountain in Utah, taking a gondola down, and repeating nine times until you have climbed 20,310 vertical feet — the equivalent of Mt. Denali, the highest peak in North America.In addition, Jesse has a new book coming out this week. An inward-facing sequel to his Goggins-fueled physical escapades, Living with the Monks* deftly chronicles Jesse’s unconventional spiritual adventure living with Russian Orthodox monks in an upstate New York monastery. Part memoir, part primer for living a less stressful and vibrant life, it’s quite the entertaining yarn.Today we get into all of it. It’s a conversation about living boundlessly. It’s about the importance of turning off the phone and embracing adventure. And it’s about the primacy of placing yourself outside your comfort zone — because there is always potential to discover, growth to mine, and life to live.But most of all, this conversation with one of the most charismatic and engaging people you will ever encounter is about why and how happiness and gratitude are neither a choice nor a destination, but an action.I love Jesse.

May 24, 2018

“Life is not about controlling the outside world. It’s about mastering perceptions from the inside.”Guru SinghThis episode marks the first installment of Guru Corner — a spiritual version of my popular Coach’s Corner series featuring my favorite teacher on all things mystic, metaphysical and ethereal, Guru Singh.For those new to the show, imagine a modern-day Gandalf who rocks like Hendrix while dropping pearls of wisdom that beautifully fuse Eastern mysticism with Western pragmatism.A celebrated third-generation Sikh yogi, master spiritual teacher, author, and musician, for the past 40 years Guru Singh has been studying and teaching Kundalini Yoga. He is the author of several books, a powerful lecturer, and behind-the-scenes guide to many a luminary, including Fortune 500 CEOs, athletes, and artists.A peer of rock legends like Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead, Guru Singh is also a supremely talented musician who began his recording career on Warner Bros’ Reprise label in the 1960s. When he isn’t recording tracks with people like Seal, he’s bringing down the house on the daily at Yoga West, his Los Angeles home base.Today’s conversation is intimate exploration into cultivating compassion, developing discernment, embracing our divinity, and ultimately expanding our capacity to do what we are here to do – to love ourselves and love others to the best of our abilities.We discuss the root of psychic and emotional pain and the nature of violence. We imagine new educational modalities for future generations. We dive deep into the power of group consciousness to drive cultural change.And we consider the importance of maturing the social infantilism of our emotional infrastructure as a social imperative.Over the last couple years, I have grown quite close with Guru Singh, a beautiful and highly relatable consciousness I’m proud to call friend, family and mentor. It’s a privilege to share more of his powerful wisdom with you today.My hope is that this conversation will empower you to more deeply invest in the development of your conscious awareness, personal boundaries, and spiritual growth.Because, to quote Guru Singh, life is not about controlling the outside world, it’s about mastering perceptions from the inside.Note: If you missed our initial two conversations, you can find them here and here.Another Note: We recorded this episode back in mid-February, so the topical events we discuss are not quite as current as they were on the date of the conversation. Nonetheless, the wisdom remains timeless.Final Final Note: The visually inclined can watch our conversation on YouTube at: http://bit.ly/gurucorner1 (just make sure to subscribe!)Let the master class begin.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

May 20, 2018

“Let’s combine hacking with our history — and where we come from — to make sure we stay in tune with evolution.”Valter Longo PhDWhen it comes to longevity, the goal isn’t just to live as long as possible.The true objective is to live as vibrantly and energetically as possible for as long as possible.So how exactly do we do this?Valter Longo, Ph.D. has devoted his life to answering this question. Along the way, his groundbreaking discoveries hold the potential to change your life in truly dramatic fashion.One of the world’s leading scientific authorities on the subject of longevity, Dr. Longo is an expert in gerontology and biological science as well as the Director of the USC Longevity Institute and the Program on Longevity and Cancer at IFOM in Milan, both of which focus on developing a better scientific understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of aging, disease and, of course, longevity.In addition, Dr. Longo is the author of an extraordinary new book entitled, The Longevity Diet*. The culmination of 25 years of research on aging, nutrition and disease across the globe, it provides an easy-to-understand, accessible and implementable road map to living to living well longer through improved nutrition.What differentiates Dr. Longo from many of his peers is that his focus is not purely academic, but practical. From his exhaustive research on aging in both mice and humans, he has created specific diet and lifestyle protocols scientifically proven to active stem cells; promote organ regeneration and rejuvenation; reduce the risk for diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s and heart disease; and ultimately extend that which we all seek: lifespan.As discussed at length over the course of our almost 2-hour exchange, Dr. Longo’s specific longevity prescription entails a daily diet regimen based on a studied group of centenarians (think Blue Zones). He then combines this with a periodic 5-day fasting protocol called the Fasting Mimicking Diet (undertaken 3-4 times per year), designed to reap the benefits of a true calorie free fast while still nourishing the body daily.This is a powerful conversation the explores all of the foregoing. It’s about what promotes longevity and what undermines it. Separating truth from misconception, it’s exploration of the benefits of fasting and the science that supports it. And it’s a primer on the optimal lifestyle protocols you can employ in your every day life to live well and long.Break out pen and paper because you’re going to want to take notes on this one.It’s an honor and a privilege to share Dr. Longo’s experience with you — one of my most important podcasts to date.I sincerely hope you not only enjoy the exchange, but employ his wisdom for your long-term well-being.Because we all deserve to live our best life.For the visually inclined, you can watch our conversation on YouTube at: http://bit.ly/richandvalterIf you are enjoying the video versions of the show, do me a favor and subscribe!I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

May 13, 2018

“Balance is overrated. Forget about being balanced and work on being present.”Dr. Michael GervaisWhat are the consistent behavioral themes across the spectrum of high performing athletes, entrepreneurs, artists, and change makers?Is there a common thread connecting those who change how we understand how the world works?Dr. Michael Gervais has devoted his life to answering these questions.A high performance psychologist working in the trenches of high-stakes environments, Michael lives and breathes in that special place where there is no luxury for mistakes, hesitation, or failure to respond.His clientele include the elite of the elite – the world’s most prolific Olympic, professional, and extreme athletes. MVPs in every major sport. High level military. Internationally acclaimed artists and musicians. And Fortune 100 CEO’s.You might recall Dr. Gervais as the guy Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll credits as integral to their 2014 Super Bowl win. The meditation, mindfulness and other crucial team building techniques Michael helped foster and instill into the fabric of that organization paved the team’s path towards incredible success.You might also remember that Felix Baumgartner’s now-infamous Red Bull Stratos jump from an altitude of 128,000 feet almost never was simply because Felix simply could not overcome the high level of anxiety and claustrophobia he experienced every time he donned the jump suit. It was Dr. Gervais who helped Baumagartner resolve the issue and get Stratos back on track. No Gervais, no history making jump.Michael is also the man behind skydiver Luke Aikins, who astonished the world by becoming the first to jump from a plane at 25,000 feet without a parachute or wingsuit and live to tell the story.A published, peer-reviewed author and recognized speaker on optimal human performance, Michael has been featured by CNN, The Wall Street Journal, ESPN, NBC, NFL Network, Red Bull TV, Extra, The Huffington Post, Outside Magazine.This is a long way of saying that Dr. Gervais is the man.While Michael’s roster includes the world’s most elite, he is about so much more than high performance athletes.Everyone is required to perform daily. We all navigate our own high stakes environments. And everybody can benefit with the right mindset training. Towards this end, Michael committed to scaling the principles that drive high performance for the betterment of all. He shares his wisdom and experience each week on his Finding Mastery podcast (subscribe immediately) and works intimately with organizations both big and small through Compete To Create, the consulting firm he co-founded with Coach Carroll.A man I consider friend and mentor, Michael is one of my very favorite people. Today we convene for a crossover episode — his third conversation on this podcast and my third appearance on his show — focused on the tools and practices required to transcend self-imposed limitations, unlock dormant potential, and lead your best, most fully expressed self.Whether you’re a high performance athlete, top tier executive, 9-5’er, weekend warrior, or a stay-at-home parent, this gem-packed conversation is for you.Because everyday, every one of us — irrespective of circumstance — has the opportunity to create a living masterpiece.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.

193,Kurt Sutter,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/kurt-sutter-365/,"Episode 365
May 9, 2018

“I should be dead. I know that. I should not be successful. I know that too. My daily existence is a toss of the coin – one side, fear, the other side, gratitude.”Kurt SutterFundamentally, I’m a people pleaser.It took years of sobriety before I realized this is more character defect than positive attribute. I continue to struggle with it often.Kurt Sutter doesn’t have this problem.A writer, actor, director, and long-time loyal friend, Kurt is a man utterly unafraid to be exactly who he is — a passionate artist committed to his creative vision for both life and art.Kurt’s description of his upbringing is vintage Sutter:Raised in the shadow of Rahway prison, Kurt spent most of his New Jersey childhood indoors, away from people, three feet from a TV screen. That’s where he learned the essentials of storytelling and the comic significance of anvils.Anvils aside, you most likely know Kurt as the creator, head writer and showrunner of Sons of Anarchy, the critically acclaimed outlaw motorcycle club psychodrama with a fanbase so rabid, it became the biggest hit television show in the FX network’s history.After humble beginnings performing off-off-Broadway in theatres, lofts and (in his words) holding cells (more vintage Sutter), Kurt caught his first major break in 2001, booking a staff writer gig on FX’s The Shield, where he spent the next seven years mastering the fundamentals of fearless television storytelling and rising up the ranks to graduate as one of the show’s coveted Executive Producers.Then came Sons. A seven-year, Shakespearean eruption of vigilantism, government corruption, racism, loyalty and human transformation, the show struck an immediate cultural nerve, cementing itself in the zeitgeist and skyrocketing Kurt to Hollywood’s A-list.Kurt’s creative output is impressive. Beyond Sons, Kurt penned Southpaw, a gritty feature-length boxing drama originally written for Eminem that ultimately starred Jake Gyllenhaal. He created The Bastard Executioner, a historical drama that ran for one season of FX, and a comic book mini-series called Lucas Stand. Mayans MC, Kurt’s third television drama for FX, is set to debut soon. And this list doesn’t even include Kurt’s many feature projects currently in development.A self-described misanthrope, let’s just say Kurt has a penchant for unapologetically speaking his mind — a disposition at odds with Hollywood etiquette that has resulted in more than a few skirmishes.But the Kurt I know — the Kurt I have been friends with for well over a decade – is a man quite apart from the reputation that often precedes him. He’s a family man. A husband and father of three children. A great friend. An example of selfless service. And an extraordinary artist.It may sound like a Cinderella story. But success for Kurt didn’t come easy. And it didn’t come early. Overweight throughout his youth, he once tipped the scale at 400 pounds. Then came the drugs and alcohol — a battle he very nearly lost.It’s a helluva ride. Today, we get into all of it.For the visually inclined, you can watch the conversation on YouTube at: http://bit.ly/richandkurt.If you are enjoying the video versions of the show, do me a favor and subscribe!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

194,Hilaree Nelson,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/hilaree-nelson-364/,"Episode 364
May 6, 2018

“It’s truly a necessity to have a passion as a compass in life.”Hilaree NelsonIt’s so easy to get comfortable. To accept life as it is. To kick back — and just settle.Luxury and ease are what we are taught to seek. But it’s actually at odds with the vitality and fulfillment most desire. My experience is that life gets interesting when you have the courage, strength and fortitude to step outside your comfort zone, face a little fear and test your limits.Because extending your boundaries strips away the non-essential, and shows you exactly who you really are.Fail or succeed, this is where all the magic happens. The growth. And a life fueled by purpose and passion.Today we explore these themes with North Face athlete Hilaree Nelson, one of the world’s most accomplished adventure athletes.Named one of National Geographic’s 2018 Adventurers of the Year, Hilaree specializes in ski-mountaineering — a discipline that involves huge and often technical mountain ascents either on skis or carrying them, then descending said peaks on skis.Over the course of her storied career, Hilaree has conquered some of the most exotic and treacherous mountain ranges on Earth. Among her many accomplishments:I first came across Hilaree by way of Down To Nothing, a stunning documentary by Renan Ozturk that chronicles a 2014 National Geographic expedition to be the first to ascend the summit of Hkakabo Razi in Myanmar to determine if it is indeed Southeast Asia’s highest point. It’s a gorgeous and gripping glimpse of Hilaree’s skill and tenacity in the face of a uniquely extraordinary challenge.This is her story.It’s an incredible conversation about fear, risk resilience, adventure and potential. It’s about balancing the pull of adventure against her responsibilities as a single mom to two boys. It’s about the allure of the outdoors.But mostly, this is an exchange about the virtues of placing yourself outside that comfort zone – and what that can teach us about potential. The preciousness of life. And what it means to be truly alive.Hilaree is a badass. It’s a pleasure to share her experience. And I sincerely hope it inspires you to seek more adventure in your life.For the visually inclined, you can watch the conversation on YouTube at: http://bit.ly/richandhilareeIf you are enjoying the video versions of the show, do me a favor and subscribe!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

April 29, 2018

“Many people don’t change until the pain associated with change is less than the pain of staying the same.”Chef AJLet’s be clear: just because you’re vegan doesn’t mean you’re healthy.To be sure, for so many reasons, eating animal free is awesome. But it’s not a wellness panacea. Oreo cookies and Lay’s potato chips are vegan. Unless your diet is liberated from the growing abundance of refined and highly processed processed foods, you’re prone to confront the same weight management issues and chronic lifestyle illnesses that plague the average consumer subsisting on the standard American diet.Just ask Chef AJ. A vegan chef for almost 40 years, she nonetheless struggled mightily with obesity for decades — prisoner to an addiction to processed snacks, refined sugar desserts, and an array of vegan junk foods that left her not only chronically overweight, but seriously unwell.AJ’s salvation came only when she finally became willing to confront her unhealthy relationship with food as a true addiction. It’s a journey that required her to completely let go of habits that no longer served her, accept help, and embrace an entirely new relationship with food in the form of a whole foods, plant-based lifestyle.This is her story — an inspiring tale of triumph and personal transformation that will leave you rethinking your own habits. Enabled with the tools required to achieve and maintain your optimal body weight. And empowered to live your best life.A former comedian, today Chef AJ is a renown plant-based chef, culinary instructor, public speaker and member of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine with a certificate in Plant-Based Nutrition from Cornell University.An expert in food addiction, emotional eating and creating meals to transform health, AJ is the host of the television series Healthy Living with Chef AJ and has appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Show with David Letterman and more. In addition, she is author of Unprocessed: How to Achieve Vibrant Health and Your Ideal Weight*. Her latest book, The Secrets To Ultimate Weight Loss* comes out soon (release date TBA).Full of life, AJ is one of my favorite health warriors, totally committed to serving others. Picking up where we left off in RRP #56 way back in 2013, this conversation is a must listen for anyone who struggles with food addiction, unhealthy cravings and a fluctuating waistline.As impactful as it is entertaining, it’s an exchange about the often under-addressed emotional aspects of eating. It’s about the hows and whys behind empowering a new relationship with food. And it’s about the joy, vitality and self-esteem that can be experienced by breaking the chains of food addiction.I sincerely hope you enjoy this interaction as much as I enjoyed having it.More importantly, my hope is that you put AJ’s insights to work — because if she can do it, you can too.A reminder that the podcast is also viewable on YouTube here: http://bit.ly/chefajrrpIf you are enjoying the videos, please subscribe!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

April 22, 2018

“You can’t rest on your laurels. You have to be constantly evolving.”Michael KlimWhat exactly does it take to become an Olympic legend?Every elite athlete is devoted to mastering their craft. Some even strike gold on the world’s largest stage. And every once in a while, we witness standout performances in consecutive Olympiads. But it’s the rare specimen that can compete at the very highest level of sport across three Olympic Games to retire a legend.Meet Michael Klim.Awarded the medal of the Order of Australia (sort of like being knighted), Michael is indisputably one of Australia’s most famous and celebrated athletes in a land that revers competitive swimming. A three-time Olympian with a slew of World Records, Olympic Gold Medals and World Championship titles to his name, he was part of a star-studded group of swimmers that took Australia back to the top of swimming in the late 1990’s & aughts — a group that included standouts like Ian Thorpe, Grant Hackett, Keiren Perkins, Leisel Jones, Libby Trickett, Stephanie Rice, and Susie O’Neill.One of the stars of the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Michael is perhaps best known as instrumental in Australia’s thrilling 4x100m relay victory, unleashing a world record lead off swim to win his first gold on the first night. Michael’s achievements also include:Quite the successful entrepreneur after hanging up his budgie smugglers (click here for the Cambridge Dictionary definition), Michael is now the founder and managing director of a skin care line called Milk & Co. and conducts life optimization retreats under the banner Chosen Experiences.This is a conversation about Michael’s extraordinary life as a lauded athlete, entrepreneur and parent.We cover his mental and physical success equation: the hows and whys behind his ascension to the very peak of elite Olympic performance. What was required of him to not just win, but keep winning. We discuss how he approaches high pressure scenarios. We cover his approach to remaining fit and how he parents his children. And we conclude with how he transitioned from decorated Olympian to successful entrepreneur — a pivot most professional athletes struggle with upon retirement.But most of all, this is a conversation about what is required to live a life of mastery, with more than a few critical takeaways you can implement into your own life.A personal hero of mine for as long as I can recall, I followed Michael’s journey from the beginning. So it was a thrill for me to finally connect with him for this deep dive into his career and what makes him tick.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Full video version >>> http://bit.ly/klimvideoIf you are enjoying the video versions of the podcast, please subscribe!Peace, Plants & Pools!Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

April 15, 2018

“Storytelling is a big part of what I do, but it’s all driven by curiosity.”Tom ScottThere is nothing more powerful than a story well told.Built into the very fabric of what makes us human, this ancient art holds the power to transform not just the individual but humanity at large.Nobody understands this better than Tom Scott — a man devoted to the idea that when curiosity, conversation and community converge, the world indeed becomes a better place.A graduate of Brown University with a Masters of Divinity from Yale, Tom is perhaps best known as the co-founder and original CEO of Nantucket Nectars. Founded in 1989 — long before it was cool to be a start-up founder — the fruit juice venture quickly grew to national prominence, making the “Inc. 500” list of fastest growing U.S. companies five years in a row and garnering Tom accolades, including the Mercury Award for Advertising and Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneur of the Year award.After selling Nantucket Nectars in 2002, Tom reinvented himself as a film and television producer. In 2004 he formed Plum TV, which owned and operated a network of stations around the country and received more than 14 Emmy awards. He produced television ads for companies like Nike and BMW. He created and produced the HBO series The Neistat Brothers with 3-time podcast guest Casey Neistat. And in 2010 he won an Independent Spirit Award for producing the feature-length film Daddy Longlegs (also with Casey).Tom’s current passion is The Nantucket Project. Akin to TED but much more intimate, TNP is both an annual event and a movement — gatherings large and small (plus a new podcast, The Neighborhood Project) that bring together thought leaders across a wide range of disciplines to explore the most relevant, cutting-edge ideas and the implications such ideas pose for the betterment of culture, society and business.I have known Tom since 7th grade. We attended junior high and high school together. These were not my favorite times, so it was incredibly healing to revisit that era with someone who was there. We discuss Tom’s entrepreneurial success. What he aims to achieve with The Nantucket Project. And the power of story to inspire wonder, cultivate community, ignite change, and unite us in this most divided time.I’ve been waiting 30 years to have this conversation. Honest, intimate and personally meaningful, it’s exactly the exchange I always hoped it would be.You’re in for a treat. Enjoy!For the visually inclined, the podcast is viewable on YouTube here: http://bit.ly/tomscottandrichIf you are enjoying the video versions of the podcast, please subscribe!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

April 8, 2018

“In a wide variety of human activity, achievement is not possible without discomfort.”Alex HutchinsonLet’s talk about limits.What is your true ceiling? How do you frame the outer edge of your capabilities?Are these checks and balances truth? or are they just beliefs you accept as fact?How you answer these questions have profound implications not only on your perception of potential, but on virtually every significant decision you make, the challenges you agree to tackle and ultimately how you view yourself and the world you inhabit.Today’s conversation asks us to rethink such restrictions — both self-imposed and external — suggesting that we are all capable of so much more than we allow ourselves to believe. That, in a word, each and every one of us holds the power to transcend our sense of what is truly possible.Because according to this week’s guest, limits are an illusion.Meet Alex Hutchinson.A National Magazine Award-winning journalist, Alex began his career as a physicist, putting his University of Cambridge Ph.D to work as a researcher for the U.S. National Security Agency. A two-time finalist in the 1,500 meters at the Canadian Olympic Trials, Alex spent his free time during the NSA years training and competing as a middle- and long-distance runner for the Canadian national team. By this I mean he is a good runner. Very good.Alex subsequently received a masters in journalism from Columbia University and today he writes about the science of endurance for Runner’s World and Outside, while frequently contributing to little-known publications like the New York Times, The New Yorker and Toronto’s Globe and Mail. FiveThirtyEight recently named him one of their “favorite running science geeks” and he was also one of only two reporters granted access to cover Breaking2 — Nike’s top secret training project to break the two-hour marathon barrier.I have been a fan and avid reader of Alex’s writing over the last few years. But what inspired me to invite him on the podcast is his phenomenal new book, Endure: Mind, Body, and the Curiously Elastic Limits of Human Performance*. A page-turning must read, it blends cutting edge science and incredible storytelling in the spirit of Malcolm Gladwell (who penned the foreword) to suggest the seemingly physical barriers we encounter when tackling a challenge are set as much by the brain as by the body.In other words, the horizons of performance are much more elastic than we once thought.Indeed, the new frontier of endurance is not the body, but the mind.Borne from a decade of intensive research shadowing elite athletes and traveling to high-tech labs around the world, this conversation with Alex beckons us to better understand and ultimately more fully express express our innate abilities. And it’s a roadmap laden with strategies, techniques and tools to manifest that untapped potential lurking within.Alex’s examination of limits is not restricted to physical performance. Defined broadly as “the struggle to continue against a mounting desire to stop,” Alex suggests that endurance is best understood as surprisingly universal, applicable to essentially every challenge we face, be it athletic, academic, professional or emotional.So even if you are not an athlete, my hope is that this conversation and the book that inspired it will leave you rethinking your limits, so that you may reach higher, push farther, and ultimately become better in whatever discipline you are devoted to mastering.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“I believe there is a champion in all of us. No matter the circumstances, each and every human being should be encouraged to achieve excellence in life. You should live your own dreams.”Frank ShamrockHe grew up in poverty. His childhood was marred by savage abuse. Violence soon followed. And it wasn’t long before the prison doors slammed shut.His future, it seemed, was cemented.But Frank Shamrock didn’t just find a way out. He transformed himself wholesale.This is his story.As unimaginable as it is inspiring, it’s a tale about the fortitude required to face a set of circumstances so dire, a state of affairs so poisonous, it would have buried the best of us. Instead, Frank prevailed. With the support of the father that adopted him, he ultimately transcended inconceivable obstacles to emerge as one of the world’s greatest mixed martial arts fighters — a heroic pioneer of modern combat sports.Dubbed The Legend during the emergent era of MMA, a time in which there were no gloves, no weight classes and basically no rules, Frank was the first true breakout champion and widely considered the sport’s first complete mixed martial arts fighter. He was the world’s first UFC Middleweight Champion. He was the first Mexican-American MMA Champion. And when the dust settled, he walked away from his career with four world titles, two world records (for the fastest championship victories in history) and the only athlete in sports history to win every major league title in MMA.Post-retirement, Frank has had successful runs as a fight commentator, a fight promoter, a UFC and Strikeforce spokesperson, a public speaker, an entrepreneur, a mentor, a philanthropist, and the author of two books, Mixed Martial Arts for Dummies* and his memoir, Uncaged: My Life as a Champion MMA Fighter* (with a foreword by Mickey Rourke).Frank’s accomplishments in the cage are amazing. But what is far more compelling is the extraordinary journey he undertook to overcome his past.This a conversation about that journey. It’s about how he did it, and what can be gleaned from his experience that can inform how we perceive and approach our own limiters, both external and internal, to achieve our potential in any area of life, irrespective of circumstances.Frank calls it the Shamrock Way. I call it unleashing your best, most authentic self.You can call it whatever you like. I ask only that you listen with an open heart.Podcast is also viewable on YouTube here.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

April 1, 2018

“Life is going to catch up to your practice.”Light WatkinsWe all want to be happy.So why is it so elusive?The problem isn’t information. We all know our contentedness is linked to eating right, sleeping well and surrounding ourselves with those who elevate. We get the importance of confronting our emotional challenges. We’re well aware that life is better when we cultivate gratitude and serve others.And yes, we know we should meditate.The science is clear. The evidence is in. And yet for so many, the gap between information and action is an impossibly untraversable canyon.Perhaps you resist the traditional trappings that swirl around the idea of meditation — the robes and incense a bridge too far. Maybe you can’t get your legs to perfectly fold, monk-like, without cramping. You decided you just don’t have the time. Or perchance you tried it, only to give up because you just couldn’t get your looping mind to shut off, convinced meditation is just not for you.Relax. You’re not alone.But today’s guest poses an important question: What if the problem isn’t meditation itself, but your approach? In other words, what if it were easy?Meet Light Watkins.Beyond having the coolest name of all time, I would characterize Light as a generous, highly accessible and contemplative entrepreneur of mindfulness. Always convivial, impressively composed, and quick with a laugh, he has been practicing and teaching Vedic Meditation for twenty years. Among his thousands of students you will find bankers, artists, politicians, CEOs, care takers, educators, comedians, rock stars, soccer moms and seekers of all kinds.An active blogger and in demand public speaker (check out his TEDx Talk), he’s also the founder of The Shine — a volunteer-based, pop-up traveling variety show that leverages music, film, philanthropy and storytelling to inspire people to do more, give more, and be more.In addition, Light recently penned a new book entitled, Bliss More* — an accessible primer that does a bang-up job of dispelling the many myths and misunderstandings that swirl around meditation with a very grounded approach and practical tools that will inspire you to finally adopt that daily practice that has to date, eluded you.So let’s put all those myths and misunderstandings to bed, once and for all.Because we can all use a little more bliss in our lives.And we all deserve to be happy.Watch & Subscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/lightwatkinsrrpI sincerely hope you enjoy this exchange with one of my very favorite people.Watch & Subscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/lightwatkinsrrpOne final note — for more on Light and his background, check out our first conversation, RRP #172 back in August 2015.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

March 25, 2018

“When we block or suppress or push aside emotions, we actually stop ourselves from being our most effective, successful beings.”Susan David PhDThe way we navigate our inner world – our everyday thoughts, emotions, and self-stories – is the single most important determinant of our life success. It drives our actions, careers, relationships, happiness, health; everything. For example: Do we let our self-doubts, failings, shame, fear, or anger hold us back? Can we be determined, persevering toward key life goals, but just as importantly, have the insight and courage to recognize when these goals are not serving us, and adapt?According to this week’s guest, the key to successfully navigating our inner world isn’t immunizing ourselves against stress and setbacks. And it doesn’t involve ignoring uncomfortable feelings. Instead, it’s developing something called emotional agility — the teachable ability to confront difficult emotions, gain critical self-insight from these feelings, and ultimately use this newfound awareness to adaptively align our values with our actions and make changes to bring the best of ourselves forward.A pioneer in her field, Susan David, Ph.D is an award-winning psychologist on faculty at Harvard Medical School, CEO of Evidence Based Psychology and co-founder of the Institute of Coaching (an affiliate of Harvard Medical School). She also serves on the Scientific Advisory Boards of both Thrive Global and Virgin Pulse.In addition, Susan is the author of the #1 Wall Street Journal bestseller, Emotional Agility: Get Unstuck, Embrace Change, and Thrive in Work and Life*. Based on a concept Harvard Business Review heralded as a Management Idea of the Year, it’s a powerful roadmap for real behavioral change — a new way of acting that will help you to reincorporate your most troubling feelings as a source of energy and creativity, and live your most successful life whoever you are and whatever you face.Susan is a frequent contributor to the Harvard Business Review, New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal. She is a sought-after speaker and consultant, with clients that include the World Economic Forum, the United Nations, Google, Microsoft, NASDAQ, and many others.If you are new to Susan, start with her moving TED Talk, The Gift and Power of Emotional Courage. A viral sensation and the inspiration for me seeking her out for the podcast, it’s accumulated almost 2 million views in the month since it’s online publication.This is a conversation about Susan’s life growing up in a South Africa divided by Apartheid, and how this experience informs her work today.It’s about how and why our emotional landscape, the everyday thoughts and stories we often hide from the world and oftentimes ourselves, are the single most important determinant of life success. And why navigating life’s twists and turns with self-acceptance, clear-sightedness, and an open mind leads to empowerment and agency.It’s about why we must overcome the urge to ignore difficult emotions and behaviors to instead face them willingly, as a neutral observer, with curiosity and kindness.It’s about identifying your core values as a path to willpower, resilience and effectiveness.And it’s about how developing this skill called emotional agility – essentially mastery over our emotions, thoughts and stories — can benefit not just ourselves but our children, helping even our youngest become better problem solvers and engaged learners more resilient against anxiety and depression.But more than anything, this is a conversation about the perils of avoiding uncomfortable feelings.Because the tough emotions are the price we pay for a meaningful life.Susan is amazing. I’m grateful for this dynamic conversation. And my hope is that you will find it as helpful and entertaining as I did.Watch & Subscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/susandavidrrpPeace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

203,Dotsie Bausch,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/dotsie-bausch-355/,"Episode 355
March 22, 2018

“There truly is a way out. Once an anorexic, NOT always an anorexic.”Dotsie BauschWe tend to think Olympic athletes live perfect, charmed lives. Genetically gifted, they inhabit a world beyond mortal challenges — physical specimens oozing talent so rare, it effortlessly skyrockets them onto the global stage.I would stridently challenge such a notion. I don’t think that is the experience of any Olympian. And it’s definitely not the experience of this week’s guest – an Olympic silver medalist with an almost unbelievably improbable story. A very human story of struggle and pain that underpins her athletic accomplishments, fueling them with a fundamental sense of purpose and meaning.A 7-time U.S. National Champion, former world record holder and two-time Pan American gold medal winner in track cycling, Dotsie Bausch earned silver in team pursuit at the 2012 London Olympics. Not only was she a long-time vegetarian at that time (she’s now vegan), she was almost 40 years old when she won that medal – the oldest ever in her discipline and one of the oldest athletes to ever compete in an Olympic Games.Dotsie’s accomplishments are extraordinary. But more remarkable is the hard-fought road this exceptional athlete trudged to achieve such heights. Because Dotsie’s greatest achievement isn’t athletic. Her biggest victory is the battle won to resurrect her life from the depths of an eating disorder so severe, it very nearly claimed her life.Now retired, Dotsie is a public speaker (check out her TEDx Talk, Olympic Level Compassion), a mentor to aspiring female professional cyclists, and a color commentator for NBC Sports. But most importantly, she is a role model for women and men around the world in their battle to return to healthy eating and living habits as an ambassador for The National Eating Disorders Association.I know Dotsie through the vegan athlete world as a staunch advocate for animal rights and the health benefits of plant-based eating for health and performance. She is also the force behind a recent anti-dairy commercial that aired during the closing ceremonies of the recent PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games. Entitled Switch 4 Good, think of it as an anti- “Got Milk” campaign featuring an array of former Olympic athletes.Disordered eating is a subject I have been wanting to explore on this podcast for quite some time. I just needed the right guest. Dotsie delivers. Her experience as both a sufferer and survivor of this surprisingly common malady is as powerful as it is instructive.This is a conversation about facing and overcoming a disease that affects up to 30 million Americans and 70 million individuals worldwide. A disease so formidable, it drove Dotsie to a suicide attempt.It’s an exchange about the bewildering nature of that disorder and the process she undertook to rebuild her life – from fashion model to athlete. It’s a conversation about her most unlikely route to Olympic glory. It’s about eating plant-based for performance. And it’s about advocacy – what it means to live in service to your ideals.If you suffer from an eating disorder or know someone who does, this is appointment listening. Towards that end, Dotsie conducts a free mentorship program for those in need. Her door is open to any and all reaching out for help. To contact her, click here.Delightful, engaging and strong, I adore Dotsie.  I love this conversation.

204,Rob Bell & Andrew Morgan,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rob-bell-andrew-morgan-354/,"Episode 354
March 18, 2018

“We want a sense of wonder and awe in our lives.”Rob BellYou know that warm, fuzzy feeling you get when two people you love, respect, and admire combine their considerable talents to create a work that exceeds the sum of it’s parts?That’s the feeling I have right now.This week I’m proud to share a conversation with two friends, each of whom have graced the show in the past — filmmaker Andrew Morgan and faith provocateur Rob Bell.Several years ago, Andrew approached Rob with an idea to make a film about the former mega-church pastor’s life and work. Rob agreed, ultimately granting Andrew unprecedented access to his world on one condition — Rob would have zero editorial input or approval over any aspect of the creative collusion.The result is the recently released documentary, The Heretic* – a behind-the-curtain deep dive into one of the most compelling and polarizing figures in modern day Christianity. With appearances by comedian Pete Holmes and author Elizabeth Gilbert, the film follows Rob over several years as he challenges deeply held conservative ideals while grappling with some of the most important questions of our time: Can faith and science coexist, or do belief and progress stand in opposition? Is religion insufficient for explaining the complexity of our modern world, or does it give language to something even greater? And do spiritual traditions simply serve to further divide our world, or can they offer real help and hope for a better tomorrow?Today we tackle all of it.An internationally recognized filmmaker devoted to telling socially conscious stories for a better tomorrow, Andrew Morgan first graced the podcast back in July 2016 (RRP #236) to discuss his beautiful and heartbreaking documentary The True Cost*. Premiering at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, it’s a movie about the untold story of fashion. It’s about the clothes we wear, the people who make them, and the impact the garment industry is having on human rights and the world we share.His experience includes a broad range of work that spans narrative and documentary storytelling for multiple film and new media projects that have been filmed and released all over the world. The New York Times described his unique style as “gentle, humane investigations” and Vogue Magazine wrote that it is “evidence that each of us can act as a catalyst for change within our own lives and work together towards a greater good.”An anti-establishment pastor making an indelible cultural impact on how we think and practice religion in the modern world, Rob Bell first appeared on the podcast in October 2016 (RRP #251). A former mega-church pastor who broke ranks with the formal church institutions and ideologies, he is an independent-minded, creative force of nature with what I would describe as a radically inclusive — almost punk rock —perspective on faith, divinity, and what it means to be human. Breaking ranks with entrenched, pedantic notions of antiquated Christian church doctrine, his message upends the divisive aspects of religious ideology, re-contextualizing the canon as a highly relatable, welcome pallium for all — a comprehensive fiat that boils down to one central premise: Love wins.Currently touring his latest show entitled Holy Shift, Rob is the author of a dozen books, including the New York Times bestsellers Love Wins*, What We Talk About When We Talk about God*, The Zimzum of Love* and How To Be Here*. His most recent book is entitled What Is The Bible?* and iTunes named his podcast, The RobCast, to it’s list of the Best Podcasts of 2015. He’s been profiled in The New Yorker. He’s toured with Oprah. And in 2011, Time Magazine named him one of the 100 Most Influential People In The World. These days, Rob’s oratory of choice isn’t of the gothic variety. Instead, he prefers to deliver his populist homilies in comedy and improv clubs, including a standing appointment at Largo, Hollywood’s buzzworthy alternative event space known more for indie rock acts like Fiona Apple, Elliot Smith and Rufus Wainwright than homilies about God and man’s place in the universe.A few weeks ago, I attended the premiere of The Heretic*. I loved it. Elegantly crafted, it’s about so much more than Rob (who, amazingly, hadn’t seen a single frame of the film until that screening). It’s a film about beauty and bravery. It’s about courage and grace. It’s about awe and wonder. And it’s about the quest for unity amidst our current, deeply polarized culture of divisiveness, discontent and religion gone awry.Rob’s unique and engaging perspective mixed with Andrew’s thoughtful commitment to positively impacting the world is a potent combination that delivers.My hope is that this documentary and conversation will provoke you to challenge entrenched beliefs that divide rather than unite us.That it will inspire you to think more deeply about faith and our collective responsibility to each other.And that it will provoke you to seek your life with both awe and wonder.Watch & Subscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/hereticrrpI sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“The politicians are not the solution. You and I are the solution as consumers.”Zach Bush MDWhat if I told you that a vast number of physical maladies are caused by inflammation, the bodyʼs immune response to a multitude of stressors. The good news? If you lose the stress — hormonal, dietary, environmental, and psychological — you remove the root cause of illness.This is but one of many fascinating ideas proffered by Zach Bush, MD — in my opinion one of the most compelling medical minds currently working to improve our understanding of human health.The founder and current director of M Clinic in Virginia, Dr. Bush was President of his medical school class at the University of Colorado Health and later became Chief Resident for the department of Internal Medicine at the University of Virginia. Among the few physicians in the nation that is triple board certified, he completed training and certification in Internal Medicine, Endocrinology and Metabolism, as well as in Hospice and Palliative care. Dr. Bush has published peer-reviewed articles and book chapters in the areas of infectious disease, endocrinology, and cancer. Through his practice and unique methodology, he has seen significant clinical improvements in patients with everything from Leaky Gut Syndrome, Gluten Intolerance, Autism, Type 2 Diabetes, Autoimmune conditions such as Crohn’s Disease, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome.I met Dr. Bush at the Conscious Capitalism Conference in Austin about six months ago. Over the course of that weekend, we had conversations that left me captivated and desperately wanting to know more. I knew immediately he would be a phenomenal podcast guest. So here we are.This is a wide-ranging, and at times mind-blowing conversation that explores new insights into the mechanisms behind human health and longevity. It’s about the massive and misunderstood impact of industrial farming, chemical pesticides, the pharmaceutical industry and even errant Western medical practices have on both human and planetary health.It’s a conversation about the difference between the science of disease and the science of health. It’s about the microbiome as a critical predictor of and protector against illness. And it’s an exploration of autism, epigenetics and the mechanics of intercellular communication.I love everything about this conversation with one caveat: we only scratched the surface of Zach’s depth of expertise. I hope to have him back to share more of his copious knowledge.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange as much as I did.Watch & Subscribe on YouTube here.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Wellness isn’t about deprivation and it’s not about perfection. It is about pointing yourself in the direction of growth.”Kathy FrestonWhere do you get your protein?Notwithstanding rising mainstream awareness that a plant-based diet provides more than enough protein for optimal health and athletic performance, every vegan continues to constantly weather this refrain.So let’s put the issue to bed, once and for all.To walk us through the myths, truths and half-truths when it comes to this hotly debated macronutrient, I sat down with the doyenne of all things vegan, my friend Kathy Freston.Returning to the show for a second appearance  (Kathy first appeared in RRP #109 in the Fall of 2014), Kathy is a wellness activist and 4-time New York Times bestselling author whose books include of  The Lean*, Veganist*, and Quantum Wellness. Her newest offering, co-authored with former podcast guest Bruce Friedrich (RRP #286), is entitled Clean Protein*, a comprehensive primer on all things protein with everything you need to know to get lean, gain energy, stay mentally sharp.A media darling, Kathy is ubiquitous. Her Oprah Winfrey Show appearance inspired the great Ms. Winfrey and her entire staff of 378 to go entirely vegan for 21 days. In addition, she has been featured on Ellen, Dr. Oz, The View, Good Morning America, Charlie Rose, The Martha Stewart Show, Extra and on the pages of Vanity Fair, Harper’s Bazaar, Self, and W. This is a conversation about the future of nutrition. It’s about the industry interests that compromise transparency and confuse consumer choice. It’s about the truth behind protein and the looming future of culture-grown, so-called clean meat.But most of all, this is a conversation about how to eat right, live well & be kind to yourself and the world we share.Podcast favorite Dan Buettner’s better half (although Dan is a pretty good half himself), I adore Kathy and everything she is about.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.For the visually inclines, you can watch the podcast on YouTube here.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

March 4, 2018

“No matter the risks we take, we always consider the end to be too soon, even though in life, more than anything else, quality should be more important than quantity.”Alex HonnoldLast week I asked you to imagine being attacked by a 9-foot bull shark.This week I invite you to envision climbing the storied 3,600-foot sheer vertical rock face known as El Capitan. The trick? You have to do it without any ropes, harnesses or any protective gear whatsoever. An astonishing prospect, even the tiniest mistake or unexpected intervening variable could cost you your life — a life that hinges moment to moment upon punctilious preparation, meticulous focus, and a preternatural relationship with fear.This is one small aspect of the life of Alex Honnold, a renown professional adventure rock climber whose audacious free-solo ascents of America’s biggest cliffs have made him one of the most masterful and compelling athletes of our generation.An global icon of athletic mastery, the lore of Alex Honnold transcends sport. I imagine many of you have viewed — with palms sweaty and jaw agape — at least one of his many stunning climbing videos. Perhaps you saw him profiled on 60 Minutes, or read profiles about him in the New York Times, National Geographic or Outside and, like me, were left to wonder:How is that even possible? How does that guy do what he does? And more importantly, why?The answer isn’t as elementary as you might imagine. It can’t be reduced to simple genetics, strength, drive, or even his most unusual relationship with fear.I think the answer is far more complex and frankly, much much more interesting. Of course, fanatical preparation plays a role. As does his fidelity to incremental progression. His unique kinship with risk is certainly a central factor.But I think what truly sets Alex apart is a profound sense of awe and wonder. An uncanny facility to meld his body and mind with spirit. And the ability to become absolutely one with his quest.Inarguably, what Alex does is both staggering and astonishing. But it’s who he is, how he lives, and what he stands for that I find most impressive.Today, we explore all of it.This conversation is everything I wanted it to be. It’s about adventure, fear, risk, curiosity, focus, mindset, preparation and the primacy of incremental progression.Over the course of almost two hours we cover his boundary-crushing El Cap solo free climb and his most recent expedition to Antarctica. We discuss his passion for environmental conservation and the benefits of his minimalist lifestyle. And of course we explore his training routines and mostly-vegan diet.But most of all, this is a conversation that not only examines the how behind Alex’s feats, but the why behind his pursuits.Thoughtful, deliberate and present, I also found Alex to be quite generous, incredibly curious, and whip smart.For the visually inclined, you can watch watch (& subscribe!) to the podcast on YouTube: http://bit.ly/richandalexI’m grateful for this exchange and I sincerely hope you enjoy it.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

February 25, 2018

“Your greatest fears can actually become your greatest strengths.”Paul de Gelder Imagine being attacked by a 9-foot bull shark.One moment you’re swimming peacefully in Sydney Harbor. The next minute you’re being rammed and pulled underwater, your leg and arm hopelessly trapped in the shark’s jaw.The pain is unimaginable.Death is certain.But somehow, against all odds, you wriggle free.Ultimately you lose that arm and that leg. But that shark? It doesn’t claim your life.Instead, it gives you an entirely new one.This is the extraordinary and inspiring ‘never say die’ story of Paul de Gelder.Truant and wayward throughout his teens, Paul left his Australian home town at an early age to start a new life. Despite some early success in the Australian music scene (he once opened for Snopp Dogg), he failed to find the purpose he so desperately sought. So he joined the Royal Australian Army as a paratrooper in November 2000 at the age of 23 — a defining moment that brought his life structure, discipline and ultimately more meaning than he could have ever imagined.Over the next several years, Paul was deployed as a United Nations peacekeeper, honing the art of jungle and urban warfare, unarmed combat, specialist communications, combat first aid, parachuting, and snipping. Rising through the ranks, Paul ultimately achieved his dream of becoming Royal Australian Navy Clearance Diver — Oz’s version of a Navy SEAL. But trouble hunted him down in the form of a brutal shark in February 2009. Paul lost two limbs, and his career as a daredevil Navy Bomb Clearance Diver was flung into jeopardy.Determined to transform the horrific experience into a net positive, he fought through excruciating pain — smashing challenge after challenge — amazing the medical staff with his unparalleled will to succeed. In the 7 years since the shark attack, Paul’s life has changed in every aspect. Today he travels the world as a top motivational speaker, passionate environmentalist, adventurer and mentor to school kids. He has spoken at venues all around the world, including the United Nations, promoting ecological conservation and (quite ironically and heroically) shark conservation. Along the way, he continues to dive with sharks all over the world — including Great Whites without a cage.One of Australia’s most in demand speakers, Paul has been featured on every major U.S. and Australian media outlet. Since 2014, he has served up co-hosting duties on Discovery Channel’s Shark Week, hosts the Nat Geo special Fearless (in which he embedded with an anti-poaching team in Zimbabwe), and worked on behind the scenes footage for the 2016 Hollywood blockbuster The Shallows with Blake Lively.Today I am proud to share Paul’s story — a death-defying tale of survival, perseverance, positivity, grit, hope, rebirth and the extraordinary breadth of human possibility.One of the most inspirational people I have ever met, this is a conversation that will leave you breathless — and inspired beyond measure.For the visually inclined, you can watch the podcast on YouTube here.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“More produce and less loneliness keep the heart doctor away.”Joel Kahn MDRecent years have seen the ascendency of low-carb, high fat diets. Indeed, the ketogenic lifestyle has been heralded as a veritable health panacea.In parallel, we bear witness to mainstream acceptance of the plant-based approach to vitality, lifestyle disease prevention and reversal.The debate pitting these distinct approaches to nutrition is as emotional as it is divisive — an impassioned war for hearts and minds waged across the scientific literature, mainstream publications and the internet that can leave even the most intelligent and well-intentioned consumer utterly baffled.So who’s right?To help divine the line between truth and fiction, Joel Kahn, MD joins the podcast for his third appearance.Dr. Kahn is an Interpreventional Cardiologist, Clinical Professor of Medicine at Wayne State University School of Medicine, Founder of the Kahn Center for Cardiac Longevity in Michigan, and a Summa Cum Laude graduate of the University of Michigan’s prestigious Inteflex program (a 6-year undergraduate / graduate program that developed doctors fresh out of high school). He’s authored hundreds of articles on heart disease, is a frequent lecturer on heart disease and its prevention, has performed thousands of cardiac procedures, and is the owner of GreenSpace Café in Ferndale and Royal Oak Michigan.In addition, Dr. Kahn is the author of five books, including The Whole Heart Solution* and his newest offering, The Plant-Based Solution*.This a comprehensive and highly instructive conversation that endeavors to provide needed clarity when it comes to the aforementioned debate — a deep dive into the veracity of nutritional research findings to provide the information you need to promote maximum health, hinder lifestyle disease, and abet longevity.In addition, we explore emerging research on the benefits of intermittent fasting and why everyone should get a coronary calcium scan.Amazingly informative, this is straight talk from a trusted and experienced man I’m proud to call friend.As a final note, this podcast episode is also available in video format on YouTube.

February 18, 2018

“We are part of nature. Nature is part of us. Stardust is in us and we are in stardust. We are all part of this same endeavor which is life and the Universe.”Jared BlumenfeldThe theme of this podcast is conversations that matter with thought leaders making a difference.My conversation with today’s guest perfectly embodies the best of this ethos.A man who has spent the last two decades fighting to create tangible benefits for communities and ecosystems alike, Jared Blumenfeld is a former U.C. Berkeley-trained international environmental lawyer with an impressive resume that includes stints at the Natural Resource Defense Council (NRDC) as well as the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) before running one of San Francisco’s first city Departments focused entirely on the environment, where he was instrumental in helping transform San Francisco into the “greenest city” in America.In 2009, President Obama appointed Jared to serve as Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator for the Pacific Southwest (Region 9), which includes California, Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada, the Pacific Islands, and 148 tribal nations. During his 7-year tenure at EPA, Jared diligently pursued environmental justice and enforcement, focusing on climate change, recycling, tribes, and drinking water. Along the way his team made massive strides in combating corporate polluters, protecting coastal waters, accelerating clean vehicle adoption and advancing tribal community environmental well being.Then, in 2016, he decided to walk away from his career to pursue a life-long dream of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail – an effort to embrace first hand the environment he has spent his life protecting.Jared has appeared frequently in The New York Times, BBC, Economist, San Francisco Chronicle, CNN, Los Angeles Times, NPR and recently launched his own podcast entitled, Podship Earth.As you might imagine,  this is a wide-ranging conversation about planetary preservation and ecological conservation.It’s a gut check on the current status of global climate change — what is contributing to it, the challenges faced in combating it, and the responsibility we all share to steward our precious planet towards a greener future.It’s also a very frank redress of our current administration’s attempt to deny reality. Right now, we’re facing an indisputably massive and ever growing threat to planetary health. Yet current EPA chief Scott Pruitt’s reversal of long-standing environmental policy buttressed by his refusal to embrace scientifically irrefutable facts related to global climate change, poses a very real threat to the long-term well-being of this spaceship we all share called Earth.It’s a conversation about what’s required, both on a policy and personal level, to correct past wrongs and steward a healthier, more sustainable path forward.And finally, it’s the story of one man’s remarkable life and his commitment to ensure a better future for us all (plus awesome stories about his four month quest to conquer the Pacific Crest Trail, and how it made him a better human).I really enjoyed this one. I hope you do too.For the visually inclined, you can watch the podcast on YouTube here.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

February 11, 2018

“You can’t write until you do.”James AltucherWhen someone fires off a long list of occupations in conversation, my instinct tells me that person probably isn’t great at any of them.James Altucher is not that guy.A hugely successful blogger, podcaster, public speaker, stand up comic, investor, entrepreneur and former VC & hedge fund manager with eighteen books to his name — including the Wall Street Journal bestseller Choose Yourself* (my personal favorite) — James is an abundantly talented polymath impacting millions of people across the world with his wry wit and often counter-intuitive ideas, all delivered with a perfect mix of intelligent insight, relatable self-deprecation and perfect comedic timing.Oh yeah, he’s also a nationally ranked chess master.Returning for his third appearance on the podcast, James is one of the smartest and most interesting intellects I know — a tremendously inspiring thinker with compelling, often controversial ideas on everything from college (don’t go), career (create your own), creativity (generate 10 new ideas every day) and finances (he’s made millions and lost millions several times over).What I find most captivating and irresistable about James is his courageous sincerity —  the willingness to write with such incredible honesty and vulnerability. It’s not only laudable, it’s the connective glue that keeps his 20 million readers hooked.In accordance with his mantra that you can’t write until you do, James puts his theories into action. Case in point? To explore minimalism he gave away all of his possessions save 15 items stuffed in a modest-sized duffle bag, and couch-surfed AirBnB’s for almost two years — an adventure that landed him on the front page of the Sunday New York Times Styles section.A ubiquitous presence on the internet, James and his writing have appeared in major media outlets including the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The New York Observer, Techcrunch, The Financial Times, Yahoo Finance, CNBC and others. His blog, JamesAltucher.com, has attracted more than 20 million readers since its launch in 2010. The James Altucher Show debuted as the #1 podcast on all of iTunes in 2014 and regularly appears in the top 100 podcasts on iTunes.Equal parts peer, friend and mentor, James is someone I could literally talk to all day about any subject. So it’s no surprise that this conversation is wide-ranging, traversing everything from what makes a great podcast to his thoughts on crypto currency. In between, we cover his exploits with minimalism, his opinions on education and his recent adventures immersed in the world of stand up comedy.I love James. I hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I enjoyed having it.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

February 8, 2018

“Meditation is not about feeling a certain way. It’s about feeling the way you feel.”Dan HarrisJoining the podcast for a second time is my friend Dan Harris, an ABC News correspondent who serves up co-anchor duties on both Nightline and the weekend edition of Good Morning America.In one of the greatest side hustles of all time, Dan has distinguished himself in recent years as a leading voice in the advocacy of meditation as a means to live both happier and more fulfilled.For those unfamiliar, Dan’s journey is compelling. An embedded war correspondent covering everything from mass shootings and natural disasters to conflicts in Myanmar, Afghanistan and the Middle East, including six visits to war-torn Iraq, Dan’s mental well-being began to suffer, his stress escalating with each overseas deployment. Depression, anxiety and PTSD ensued, followed by self-medicating with drugs like cocaine and ecstasy. Ultimately, these factors conspired to take a serious toll on Dan’s mental and physical health, culminating in a meltdown of epic proportions in 2004 when he suffered an on-air panic attack while delivering the news that was witnessed by 5 million people.Although unsure as to the cause of his breakdown, it was a wake up call that led him to seek professional help. At the same time, in a bizarre stroke of synchronicity, Peter Jennings assigned Dan to begin covering stories on faith, religion and spirituality. Dan was less than enthusiastic about this, but ultimately it was this exploration that that eventually led Dan to understand that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head.  A thinking mind which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business yet also led him to make the decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out.We all have that voice in our head. It’s what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we’re not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we’re stuck with this voice – that there’s nothing we can do to rein it in – but Dan stumbled upon an effective way to do just that.It’s a protocol he initially dismissed as useless, but which ultimately not only saved his life, but gave him a new one altogether:Meditation.After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Dan took a leap of faith. A deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even prison guards and marines who are now using it for increased calm, focus, and happiness. Dan chronicles his experiences in his highly entertaining and illuminating memoir, 10% Happier* and provides a practical guide to the actual hows and whys of meditation in the recently released, 10% Happier: Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics*.In many ways, Dan is the perfect ambassador for meditation. The furthest thing from a monk or a guru, he’s a professional family man living in New York City — a highly relatable, very human being who, just like all of us, is trying to live just a little bit better and a little bit happier in the face of life’s daily pressures.This is a conversation about the power of meditation to combat and overcome the thought patterns and behaviors that drag us down. It’s about the science that establishes meditation as an effective tool to quite literally rewire our brains — all while lowering our stress response, reducing our blood pressure, and alleviating depression.But mostly, this is a conversation directed at the skeptic.Perhaps you’re convinced meditation wont work for your unique problems. Maybe you just don’t quite understand how to do it. Or you dismiss it as a frivolous waste of time. If so, then this wide ranging conversation with Dan picking up where we left off last time (RRP #97), is appointment listening.For the visually inclined, you can also watch our conversation on YouTube.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“The journey is to find your truth and know who you really are.”Danica PatrickImagine yourself the only female athlete in a very dangerous sport completely dominated by men.You don’t just hold your own. And you don’t just break the glass ceiling. Instead, you obliterate it. Kicking serious ass, you make an indelible mark on the sport you love. Along the way, you inspire millions of women and young girls to rethink the limits of their personal potential.This is the extraordinary story of race car driver Danica Patrick (@danicapatrick) — an  athlete whose life-long love for speed turned her into one of the most successful, revered, and recognizable professional sports figures on the planet. Although her accomplishments are far too numerous to list, among Danica’s many notable glass ceiling explosions include:Off the track, Danica is a media magnet. She has served up hosting duties on Spike TV, been featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated, and appeared in a litany of commercials, music videos, and television shows. In 2006, she published Danica: Crossing the Line*, an autobiography she followed up with the recent release of her brand new mind, body, spirit primer: Pretty Intense*.This is a conversation about Danica’s extraordinary career. It’s about the lessons she’s learned along the way about life, performance and wellness. It’s about a piece of unfinished business she calls the Danica Double — her plan to race both the Daytona 500 and the Indy 500 this year — and it’s a glimpse into the new chapter that lays beyond racing.But most of all, this is a conversation about personal empowerment. It’s about the mindset and practices that made Danica a champion, which can be leveraged to unlock the best version of yourself. In other words, take personal responsibility for your path. Stop wasting time. And start kicking ass.Danica is one of the sweetest badasses I know. I totally enjoyed our exchange.

January 21, 2018

“We shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium.”Winston Churchill Unbeknownst to most, animal agriculture is the number one culprit when it comes to almost every single man-made environmental ill on the planet.Untenable amounts of land, water and feed are required to raise the number of animals necessary to meet demand. Creating more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire transportation sector combined, our voracious appetite for meat and dairy products has produced the largest mass species extinction since the disappearance of the dinosaurs. Meanwhile, the primary driver of ocean acidification, water table pollution, rainforest devastation and a litany of other environmental abominations can be tracked to one primary source: our broken system of food production.Without a doubt, it’s a system that’s destroying human health, irreparably damaging the planet we call home and creating unspeakable suffering in the process.If we want to survive as a species, we need a new way forward. In my opinion, adopting a plant-based is the single most powerful and impactful thing you can possibly do as a conscious, compassionate consumer. It is the medicine that will prevent and reverse chronic lifestyle disease, preserve our planet’s precious resources for future generations, and put an end to mass animal cruelty.Vegan has indeed gone mainstream. That’s awesome. But let’s not be naïve. The rate at which people are adopting a plant-based lifestyle can’t begin to match population growth and its concomitant demand for cheeseburgers and milk shakes.7.5 billion people currently share this spinning blue planet we call Earth. By 2050, that number will escalate to 9.7 billion. By 2100? 11 billion.How can we possibly feed 11 billion people sustainably?Ask my good friend Paul Shapiro, and he will give you a two-word answer:Clean meat.When Paul — a long-time vegan and mainstream voice for agricultural sustainability — took his first bite of “lab-harvested” meat in 2014, more humans had gone into space than had eaten real meat grown outside an animal. But according to Paul, the clean meat revolution is upon us — and it holds the potential to save the world.Just as we need clean energy to compete with fossil fuels, clean meat is poised to become a competitor of factory farms. Clean meat isn’t an alternative to meat; it’s real, actual meat grown (or more accurately, brewed) from animal cells, as well as other clean animal products that ditch animal cells altogether and are simply built from the molecule up.Today we talk about it.In addition to being among the worldʼs first clean meat consumers, Paul served as the vice president of policy engagement for the Humane Society of the United States, the worldʼs largest animal protection organization. Paul is also the founder of Compassion Over Killing, a TEDx speaker, and an inductee into the Animal Rights Hall of Fame.Paul just released his first book, Clean Meat:How Growing Meat Without Animals Will Revolutionize Dinner and the World*, a Washington Post bestseller (with a great foreword by Sapiens* author Yuval Noah Harari) that chronicles the wild race to create and commercialize cleaner, safer, sustainable meat—real meat—without the animals. From the entrepreneurial visionaries to the scientists’ workshops to the big business board­rooms—Shapiro details that quest for clean meat and other animal products and examines the debate raging around it.This is a conversation about animal agriculture, planetary health and human well-being. It’s about the politics of agriculture and the subsidies, corporations, representatives and lobbyists that support it.This is also a discourse on everything “clean meat.” What exactly is it? Who are the players behind it? How is it actually produced? When is it actually going to be available? And how does it solve the most pressing sustainability problems we face as a species?But mostly, this is an optimistic forecast of food system innovation — how technology, urgency and popular demand are rapidly converging to create healthy, sustainable and compassionate solutions to help solve our current food, health and environmental crises.If you enjoyed my podcast with Bruce Friedrich of the Good Food Institute (RRP #286), then you will dig this one.Finally, for those visually inclined, you can watch our conversation on YouTube here.Enjoy!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

January 14, 2018

“Stability doesn’t create discipline, discipline creates stability.” Amy Dresner Shame can’t survive the light.I’ve said it before, but it bears repeating.If you’ve been on this podcast adventure with me for a while, then you know well that addiction, alcoholism and recovery are recurring themes of the show — subjects very close to my heart as someone whose life has been spared by sobriety.These themes recur because millions of people from every cross section of life suffer in silence. Deeply ashamed and terrified to confront their truth, these lost souls dwell in the shadows. Paralyzed and powerless, addiction strips them of their humanity as they descend into darkness, wandering lost and alone in what author and addiction medicine specialist Gabor Maté (RRP #188) dubs the realm of the hungry ghost.As a culture we perpetuate the cycle of shame by judging those afflicted as weak, even sub-human. This creates a climate of fear and silence, further entrenching a deep sense of self-hatred that drives the addict into a prison of loneliness and despair, isolating that individual from the life-saving solution to their fatal disease.But shame can’t survive the light.So let’s shine a light on it.Towards that end, I give you the story of Amy Dresner.A former stand up comic, recovering drug addict and all around fuck up (her words), Amy is a writer and author who humorously chronicles her epic ups and downs for The Fix, Refinery 29, Alternet, After Party Chat, Salon, The Frisky, Cosmo Latina, Addiction.com and Psychology Today.I first came across Amy by way of our mutual friend (and record-setting 8-time podcast guest) Mishka Shubaly and her recently released memoir, My Fair Junkie: A Memoir of Getting Dirty and Staying Clean*. I dig a good addiction yarn, and Amy’s descent into the throes of addiction and ultimate redemption is one for the ages.Growing up in Beverly Hills, Amy had it all: a top-notch private school education, the most expensive summer camps and even a weekly clothing allowance. But at 24, she started dabbling in meth in San Francisco and unleashed a fiendish addiction monster. Soon, if you could snort it, smoke it, or have sex with, she did. Smart and charming, with daddy’s money to fall back on, she sort of managed to keep it all together. But on Christmas Eve of 2011, all of that changed when, high on Oxycontin, she stupidly “brandished” a bread knife on her husband and was promptly arrested for felony domestic violence with a deadly weapon. Within months, she found herself in the psych ward–and then penniless, divorced and looking out on a court-ordered 240 hours of community service. For the next two years, assigned to a Hollywood Boulevard “chain gang,” she would sweep up syringes (and worse) on Hollywood Boulevard as she bounced from rehabs to halfway houses, all while struggling with sobriety, sex addiction, and starting over in her 40s.Amy pulls no punches. Her raw honesty is as devastating as it is courageous – perhaps even shocking for those less intimately familiar with the ravishes of addiction. But she’s also hilarious.Today we get into all of it.This is a candid conversation about the dark underbelly of drug abuse, sex addiction, and alcoholism. It’s about violence, fear, self-hatred, and shame. It’s about the very real struggle to survive. And it’s about the conviction and strength required to achieve sobriety.But between the lines, this is a powerful exchange about courage — the courage to face and ultimately own your truth. And it’s about how that ownership holds the power to overcome shame, heal the self, and ultimately help others.Because shame can’t survive the light.If you suffer from addiction or know someone who does, you will find Amy’s story both powerful and instructive – a primer to better understand the nature of this pernicious disease.For those that don’t have a problem, I would encourage you to think about addiction in a broader context.Addiction is a spectrum. I’m convinced it’s a malady that should be more broadly defined. All of us suffer, either consciously or unconsciously, from some kind of unhealthy and reactive obsession or compulsion we feel powerless to resist or overcome. If not a substance, perhaps it’s a behavior. Or maybe it’s a thought pattern. The point is that we can all live more present, mindful and intentional about what we put into our bodies, how we behave, perceive ourselves and others, and navigate the world we inhabit.This is the spirit in which I offer this conversation — my desire only that you listen with both heart and mind open.Peace + Plants,Listen, Watch & Subscribe                  Apple Podcasts | YouTube | Soundcloud | Stitcher | GooglePlayThanks to this week’s sponsors22 Days Nutrition: the 100% plant-based, 100% USDA certified organic nutrition products and meal delivery platform designed to meet the needs of your healthy, active life. For 10% off all products (including the meal delivery) and free shipping, visit 22daysnutrition.com/richroll and use promo code RICHROLL at checkout.Squarespace: The easiest way to create a beautiful website, blog, or online store for you and your ideas. Save 10% at checkout when visit squarespace.com and use the coupon code “RICHROLL” at checkout.Show NotesCheck out Amy’s book: on: My Fair Junkie: A Memoir of Getting Dirty and Staying Clean*Background, Context & ReferenceNotable People DiscussedRelated Podcasts You Might EnjoyThanks to Jason Camiolo for production, audio engineering interstitial music and show notes and Shawn Patterson for graphics.

January 11, 2018

“Instead of being ashamed of doing what you do or being what you are, I ask two important questions: Why not celebrate it? Why not be proud of the fact that the body you are in can do great things?” Mirna Valerio What is a runner? How do we define an athlete? What does it truly mean to be fit and healthy?Challenging stereotypes, today’s guest demands that we broaden our limited definition of these terms.She may not be fast, but she runs. In fact she runs a lot, an impressive slew of ultramarathons to her name.She’s also not skinny. In fact, she’s big.250 pounds big.But Mirna Valerio is without a doubt a runner.In fact, the force of nature affectionately known as The Mirnavator is one of the most inspirational athletes I have ever met — a true ambassador of sport on a mission to empower women of all shapes and sizes to proudly embrace their bodies, expand their horizons, and own their truth.Carrying herself with grace, an intelligent self-confidence and a smile so gleeful it brightens all in her path, Mirna’s appeal has less to do with her ability to run long distances and everything to do with her unapologetic celebration of her personal truth.Mirna’s joyful self-acceptance is both real and rare. It’s both authentic and bold. It’s as infectious as it is inclusive.And it’s incredibly empowering to the millions of people who suffer body shame issues silently.When she’s not running, the Brooklyn native (now living in the North Georgia Mountains with her husband and teenage son) is a Spanish teacher, diversity practitioner, cross-country coach, and author of the wildly popular blog Fat Girl Running. She also writes frequently for Women’s Running Magazine and recently released a remarkable memoir I thoroughly enjoyed entitled, A Beautiful Work In Progress*.She’s been profiled in the Wall Street Journal and Runner’s World and on NBC Nightly News. She’s also an ambassador for a variety of brands like REI, Merrell, Skirt Sports and Swiftwick. Just this week Mirna became one of the faces of JC Penney’s newly launched Here I Am campaign.I first came across Mirna’s story by way of a mini-documentary produced by REI called The Mirnavator that went viral. Hooked, I was determined to share her powerful story with you. Mirna more than delivered.Much like past episodes with Josh LaJaunie, Adam Sud, David Clark and my most recent episode with Charlie Jabaley, this is an incredibly inspiring underdog every person story.But unlike those tales, Mirna’s journey is not one marked by dramatic before and after photos. On the contrary, this is a story about body acceptance and body positivity.It’s a conversation about self-empowerment and self-acceptance. It’s about tackling stereotypes, overcoming prejudice and the importance of inclusion. And it’s an exchange about the need to redefine how we think about and define athleticism, the spirit of sport, and fitness in general.But more than anything, this is a conversation about owning your truth.I adore Mirna and I absolutely love this conversation. I think you will too.Please stick around to the very end for a treat. In addition to her impressive accomplishments, Mirna is also an extremely talented, Julliard-trained opera singer. I was able to convince her to take us out with her angelic, ethereal voice.

January 7, 2018

“I knew I had to change everything in my life if I wanted to live.”Charlie JabaleyHe dreamed of being a professional athlete.But Charlie Jabaley was always the fat kid, picked last for kickball.No matter what, he just couldn’t stop gaining weight. Resigned to this fate, he abandoned his athletic dream early.Throwing himself into business instead, it wasn’t long before CEO Charlie was born — an alter ego he created at age 13 that would soon become a self-fulfilling prophecy.By his mid-twenties, Charlie had overcome tremendous odds to achieve extraordinary success in the music business, collecting Grammys and counting Benjamins managing a stable of major hip-hop recording artists like 2 Chainz.The very model of the modern millennial entrepreneur, Charlie’s path provided the high gloss lifestyle of his wildest imagination — a world apart from his humble beginnings.What it didn’t provide? Health, happiness, or an authentic sense of wholeness.On the outside, Charlie was crushing it. On the inside, he was dying. A life-long junk food addict, he had swelled to over 300 pounds by the age of 29. But he wasn’t just morbidly obese. And he wasn’t just chronically depressed.Charlie Jabaley was lost.His health in rapid decline, he tried countless diets, but always gained the weight right back — plus a little extra.He tried running. He even ran three marathons. Ironically, Charlie nonetheless continued to pack the pounds on, rewarding his training sessions with shame-inducing binges. Out of control, Charlie’s waistline only expanded in lockstep with each successive 26.2 effort.Deep down, Charlie knew he would forever remain a prisoner to his seemingly hopeless food addiction until he could summon the courage to face the emotional dysfunction, mental imbalance and spiritual malaise that had been driving his unhealthy lifestyle choices for as long as he could remember.The inside job terrified Charlie. But it’s always darkest before the dawn. At the nadir of his hopelessness, Charlie awoke one day to find his bedroom spinning before suddenly collapsing to the floor. A visit to the doctor only brought more bad news.Charlie Jabaley has a brain tumor.But rather than treat his diagnosis as tragic, Charlie decided to embrace it as a gift — the push he needed to once and for all to face himself honestly, take willing inventory of his life, and finally undertake the measures necessary to save himself from himself.Charlie Jabaley only had to change one thing — everything.One year ago, he walked away from the company he started, leaving millions of dollars on the table to decamp Atlanta for Los Angeles. Completely restructuring his relationship with food, he’s lost over 120 pounds and kept it off. Without medication, his tumor has shrunk to almost nothing. And Charlie has finally achieved his lifelong dream, transforming himself from executive (CEO Charlie) to athlete (Charlie Rocket), training for his first Ironman in New Zealand this March.For the first time in his life, he’s both healthy and happy.But mostly, Charlie Jabaley is free.What he did, how he did it and why is the subject of today’s conversation. It’s a powerful exchange with an everyman hero who wants you to know that you do not struggle alone.  That it’s never too late to change. And no matter how far you have drifted from the person you aspire to be, there is both hope and help.Welcome to 2018 people.

December 21, 2017

“The cleanest burning fuel you can get for the human body is from plants.” Rip Esselstyn Friend, mentor and original Plantstrong pioneer Rip Esselstyn and I go way back.Both swimmers, we crossed paths at many a meet — as young teens and later as collegiate rivals (Rip was always far more accomplished than I). During the early stages of my transition to a plant-based diet, I vividly recall perusing Facebook when I stumbled upon Rip, who just happened to be on the precipice of publishing his first book on the very subject I was attempting to master. From that moment forward, Rip became a lighthouse — illuminating my path as a generous friend and cheerleader always available to share his knowledge, experience and inspiration.Today, Rip (finally) joins the podcast to share that knowledge, experience and inspiration with you — a hotly anticipated master course on the incredible power of a whole-food, plant-based diet to prevent and reverse disease, promote optimal health, and fuel your athletic dreams.Educated at the University of Texas at Austin, Rip was a three-time All-American swimmer before spending a decade as one of the premier professional triathletes in the world. He then joined the Austin Fire Department where he introduced his passion for a whole-food, plant-based diet to Austin’s Engine 2 Firehouse in order to rescue a firefighting brother’s health. To document his success he wrote the New York Times’ bestselling book, The Engine 2 Diet*, which demonstrates the irrefutable connection between a plant-based diet and good health.Rip left his job as a firefighter in 2009 to team up with Whole Foods Market as one of their Healthy Eating Partners to raise awareness for Whole Foods employees, customers and communities about the benefits of eating a plant-strong diet. As the founder of Engine 2, Rip develops and implements a range of programs and events geared toward education, inspiring and nurturing plant-strong living for individuals, families and organizations across the globe.A New York Times bestselling author of four books, Rip has appeared on hundreds of radio and national television shows, including the Today Show, CBS Sunday Morning, Good Morning America and The Dr. Oz Show. Each year his family produces a series of all-inclusive, immersive events, culminating in Camp Plantstock — an extraordinary experience I highly recommend to anyone looking to reboot their lifestyle. Finally, Rip’s newest book, The Engine 2 Cookbook* hits bookstores everywhere on December 26, 2017.This is a conversation I’ve been anticipating since the first episode of this podcast. Specific topics discussed include:Appointment listening, this is an amazing conversation about the extraordinary and indelible power of plants to heal and empower.My last long-form conversation of 2017 (the next two episodes feature an excerpted anthology of the best conversations over the past year), my hope is that Rip’s message will leave you excited and empowered to embrace a healthier, plant-fueled you in 2018.For those visually inclined, the video version of the podcast is also available on YouTube.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

December 17, 2017

“It’s not just about being against cruelty. It’s about being for compassion.” Nathan RunkleReared on a farm in rural Ohio, Nathan Runkle’s connection with farm animals runs deep. So deep, he always knew his life would center around the protection and care of these sentient beings.After a local farmed animal abuse case involving a piglet slammed headfirst into a concrete floor during an agriculture project at a nearby high school, Nathan founded Mercy For Animals to give “food” animals a much-needed advocate in his local community.He was just 15 years old.Today, Nathan is the very person he was always meant to be: a world renown animal rights advocate; a nationally recognized speaker; and the man who has tactfully shepherded Mercy For Animals from that high school project into a leading international force in the prevention of cruelty to farmed animals and the promotion of compassionate food choices and policies.Named one of the country’s “Top 20 Activists Under 30 Years Old” and the youngest person ever inducted into the U.S. Animal Rights Hall of Fame (he was 25), Nathan has been featured in hundreds of prominent media outlets and has spent decades working alongside elected officials, corporate executives, heads of international organizations, academics, farmers, celebrities, and film producers to pass landmark legislation and implement animal welfare policy changes.Nathan is also the author of the new and aptly titled, Mercy For Animals*. A fascinating call-to-action memoir, the book chronicles Nathan’s personal story from grassroots activist to global animal rights leader while elucidating the history and current state of U.S. factory farming and animal welfare; the environmental and human health implications of food policy; and the compassionate future he envisions.Today I go deep with someone who always knew exactly who he wanted to be and what he wanted to do with his life.We dig into Nathan’s early interest in animal welfare, the founding of MFA in his teens and the undercover work that followed. We discuss the current state and implications of factory farming on animal, human and planetary health. And we review the regulatory landscape that governs our food systems and the implications of the clean meat movement on the future of food.But ultimately, this is a conversation about being who you are. It’s about turning compassion into action. It’s about the ethical and environmental implications of our daily food choices. And it’s about the power we all hold to create change and forge a more compassionate and sustainable world for generations to come.For the visually inclined, the video version of the podcast is also available on YouTube.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

December 10, 2017

“When you put on really effective armor, you do keep things out but you also keep a lot in.”Tim FerrissIf you think you know Tim Ferriss, think again – this is Tim like you’ve never seen or heard him before.A relentless experimenter and virtuoso of deconstruction, Tim has spent the better part of his adult life studying mastery and sharing what he has learned on his wildly popular blog and string of four consecutive #1 New York Times and #1 Wall Street Journal bestselling books, which include The 4-Hour Workweek*, The 4-Hour Body*, The 4-Hour Chef*, Tools of Titans*, and his brand new offering, Tribe of Mentors*.Along the way, Tim became a prominent angel investor and philanthropist, named one of Fast Company‘s “Most Innovative Business People” and one of Fortune‘s “40 under 40”. He’s graced the main stage at TED and been featured in every prominent media outlet imaginable. His work hosting The Tim Ferriss Show podcast – one of the most widely listened to podcasts in the world with over 200 million downloads — led The Observer to call him “the Oprah of audio”.I’m willing to bet most of you are already decidedly familiar with this globally renowned polymath. Like you, I’ve followed his blog for years. I’ve read all his books and I listen to his podcast regularly. It’s an understatement to say that Tim’s work has been instrumental in helping me forge the life I’m blessed to lead today. For that I am forever grateful.Nonetheless, I never felt like I really knew the man behind the work.Who is the real Tim Ferriss?It turns out, Tim has been asking himself the very same question. Over the last year, he has endured much. The loss of some good friends matched by turning 40 has left him pondering his mortality. He walked away from tech investing, decamping Silicon Valley for Austin out of a desire to slow the pace of his frenetic life. And a very intense recent 10-day silent meditation retreat is emblematic of a redirected focus inward.Today finds Tim in a rather reflective and contemplative place. A point in time in which he is wrestling with his past, evaluating the person he wants to be, and deeply contemplating what is most important about life.Today we unpack the real Tim Ferriss.Intimate and emotionally raw, this is exactly the kind of conversation I have been patiently waiting to have with Tim ever since I started this podcast – a sincere, deeply personal exchange with the human being behind the success and fame.I’m honored to be a trusted steward for this conversation – an experience that will leave you with an entirely new perspective on one of culture’s most influential figures.For those visually inclined, the video version of the podcast is also available on YouTubeI sincerely hope you enjoy our talk as much as I enjoyed having it.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Who are we if we disconnect from the prince / princess paradigm?”Julie PiattToday’s podcast is the last in my series of open panel discussions lifted from our Plantpower Ireland retreat this past July. It’s a powerful participatory discourse and Q&A hosted by myself, Julie and Colin Hudon, a physician of Traditional Chinese Medicine and founder of Living Tea which imports the finest living teas sourced from ancient tea trees across both China and Taiwan.Today we focus on relationships. Specifically, we explore:At its core, this is a powerful master class on redefining how we relate to our most loved ones so that we can experience the best of what a relationship can bring to the collective human experience.One more thing: if the Ireland retreat sounded cool (it was a giant blast), our next retreat will be in Tuscany, Italy May 19-26, 2018. It’s currently sold out, but because it’s not unusual for a person or two to drop out, you can still join the waiting list or reserve your spot for 2019.

“Every power that any human being has ever had here on Earth is in every single one of us waiting to be activated.”Guru SinghAs we approach the year’s end, I thought it appropriate to reconvene with the great and vast consciousness that helped us usher in 2017 – kundalini yoga & meditation master Guru Singh (@gurusinghyogi).Long-time listeners will well recall our initial conversation from January (RRP #267), one of my most popular and impactful episodes in the history of this podcast.For those new to the show, imagine a modern-day rock star Gandalf dropping mad guitar licks between pearls of timeless wisdom that beautifully fuse Eastern mysticism with Western pragmatism and you start to get the picture.Named Best Guru in LA by Los Angeles magazine, Guru Singh is a celebrated third-generation Sikh yogi, master spiritual teacher, author, and musician. For the past 40 years he has been studying and teaching Kundalini Yoga – a 5,000 year old ancient science and school of yoga focused on awakening the primal energy known as shakti for the purpose of spiritual enlightenment. He is the author of several books (enumerated below) and a powerful lecturer uplifting thousands worldwide. An extraordinary teacher, he also serves as a behind-the-scenes guide to many a luminary, including Fortune 500 CEOs, athletes, artists and even Tony Robbins.A peer of rock legends like Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and the Grateful Dead, Guru Singh is also a supremely talented musician who began his recording career on Warner Bros’ Sire label in the 1960s. When he isn’t recording tracks with people like Seal, he’s bringing down the house on the daily at Yoga West, his Los Angeles home base.Over the past year, I have become close with Guru Singh — a beautiful and highly relatable consciousness I’m proud to call a good friend and valuable mentor.Today we discuss everything from the benefits of cold-water therapy to the implications of artificial intelligence.We examine the why behind all the recent mass shootings and explore strategies for navigating the treacherous minefields of our deeply divided culture.We envision new educational modalities for future generations.We investigate the effects of diet beyond the physical level.And we consider the importance of maturing the social infantilism of our emotional infrastructure as a cultural imperative.It’s aways an honor to spend time with Guru Singh and it’s a privilege to share more of his powerful wisdom with you today.My hope is that this conversation will empower you to more mindfully navigate our volatile world and encourage you to more deeply invest in the development of your conscious awareness, personal boundaries, and spiritual growth.To rise up, you gotta lie down.So let’s lie down with Guru Singh.For the visually inclined, the video version of the podcast is also available on YouTubeI sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

227,Live In Dublin With The Happy Pear,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/dublin-live/,"Episode 331
November 30, 2017

“We are energy. So doesn’t it make sense that the energy we put into our bodies impacts the energy that comes out of our bodies?”Rich RollThis special mid-week edition of the podcast features a Q&A event that Julie and I hosted along with our friends Stephen & David Flynn of The Happy Pear that took place before a live audience at the gorgeous Smock Alley Theatre this past summer in Dublin, Ireland.Long-time listeners will well remember David and Stephen from #RRP 233, one of my most popular episodes of 2016.For those newer to the show, David & Stephen Flynn are the joined-at-the-hip identical twin brothers behind The Happy Pear, a family run chain of natural food stores and cafés in Ireland as well as a line of organic, locally harvested plant-based food products available across the UK.David & Stephen are also the co-authors of two incredible cookbooks – The Happy Pear* (of course) and the more recently released World of the Happy Pear*, both runaway, smash bestsellers across Ireland the UK.Fundamentally, The Happy Pear is a movement. A movement rooted in family and community with one singular goal — to make healthy food and lifestyle mainstream. When the super fit dads aren’t making pre-school breakfast picnics on the beach, engaging in impromptu handstand competitions, conducting community-oriented health education courses, or traveling extensively for public speaking, they enthusiastically guide a vast and devoted global audience of wellness warriors across every social media platform from YouTube to Instagram to Snapchat with an endless stream of highly entertaining, quality nutrition and fitness tips, recipes, and daily slice-of-life vlogs with inspiration for miles.David and Stephen Flynn just might be the most charismatic and emphatic advocates for healthy living I have ever met.I sincerely hope you enjoy our live presentation, which includes loads of great questions from the audience.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

228,Drs. Dean & Ayesha Sherzai,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/team-sherzai/,"Episode 330
November 26, 2017

“Food is the single greatest tool we have in the fight against Alzheimer’s.”Team SherzaiWhile other major diseases are in decline, deaths from Alzheimer’s have increased dramatically in recent decades.In fact, Alzheimer’s is currently the 6th (and due to massive under-reporting may be as high as the 3rd ) leading cause of death in the United States.Right now, over 47 million people worldwide currently live with Alzheimer’s. By 2050, it’s predicted this form of dementia will plague 135.5 million people across the globe.This disease has become so pervasive, chances are you have been directly or indirectly impacted through an afflicted loved one. If so, then you know first hand the devastation it creates. You’ve seen it’s ravaging effects. Perhaps you’ve even shouldered the immense emotional, financial and social burden it produces — and the hopelessness it provokes.The sad truth is that Alzheimer’s is a condition that Western medicine has utterly failed to combat, let alone cure. Simply put, there is no pharmaceutical or surgical treatment to effectively prevent or reverse this savage and cataclysmic condition.But there is hope.Alzheimer’s isn’t a genetic inevitability. A diagnosis doesn’t have to come with a death sentence. In fact, according to this week’s guests, 90% of all Alzheimer’s cases can be prevented. And for the 10% with a strong genetic risk for cognitive decline, the disease can be delayed for ten to fifteen years.These are not estimates. Nor are they wishful thinking. They are conclusions based on rigorous science performed by neurologists Drs. Dean and Ayesha Sherzai. Co-directors of the Brain Health and Alzheimer’s Prevention Program at Loma Linda University Medical Center, Team Sherzai is the dynamic husband and wife duo behind the largest clinical and observational study on Alzheimer’s to date as well as the co-authors of The Alzheimer’s Solution*, a must-read primer that details their extensive research, chronicles the remarkable results they have experienced working with patients first-hand, and sets forth the first ever comprehensive program to prevent Alzheimer’s disease, improve cognitive function, and ultimately optimize long-term brain health.The solution might surprise you. It’s not due to a breakthrough in surgical procedures. It’s not the result of new pharmaceutical trials. Instead, as far fetched as it may sound, the answer is rooted in fundamental, simple changes in nutrition and lifestyle.Dr. Dean Sherzai, M.D., PhD., completed his medical and neurology residencies at Georgetown University with a subsequent fellowship in neurodegenerative diseases at the National Institutes of Health, followed by a second fellowship in Dementia and Geriatrics at the University of California, San Diego. He also holds two Masters Degrees; in advanced sciences at UCSD and a Masters in public health from Loma Linda University. Finally, he has received a Ph.D. in Healthcare leadership at Loma Linda/Andrews University.Dr. Ayesha Sherzai, M.D., completed her medical residency at Loma Linda University. She subsequently completed a residency in preventive medicine and neurology and thereafter received a fellowship in vascular neurology from Columbia University, and is currently finalizing her PhD in Epidemiology at Loma Linda University. Ayesha also has a culinary degree, giving her a unique understanding of nutrition as a powerful tool for disease prevention.This week I sit down with Team Sherzai for an in-depth, powerful and potentially life-altering conversation that provides everything you need to know about brain health, Alzheimer’s and how to avoid the grip of this devastating illness. Specific topics covered include:Given the rapidly expanding reach of diseases related to cognitive decline, I consider this episode a must listen for everyone, especially for those at genetic risk or otherwise impacted by a loved one who currently suffers.I sincerely hope you listen keenly. And please don’t hesitate to share this episode with anyone in your circle who can benefit from Team Sherzai’s experience and wisdom. For the visually inclined, the video version of the podcast is also available on YouTubePeace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Stay healthy, stay motivated and be positive.”Chris Hauth  Today, I am once again joined by Chris Hauth (@AIMPCoach) for another edition of Coach’s Corner focused on maintaining fitness with engaged enthusiasm as we navigate the winter months.For those new to the show, Chris is a sub-9 hour Ironman, former professional triathlete, two-time Olympian and one of the world’s most respected endurance coaches. In 2006, Chris won the Ironman Coeur D’Alene and went on to be the first American amateur & 4th overall American at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii.When he’s not training and racing, Chris runs AIMP Coaching, mentoring a wide spectrum of athletes ranging from elite professionals — including Ironman and Western States top finishers, Ultraman winners and Olympic Trials qualifiers — to first time half-marathoners. Under Chris’ tutelage since 2008, he deftly guided me through three Ultraman World Championships, EPIC5. and now Ötillö.A friend and mentor as much as a coach, Chris has been my personal coach since 2008, expertly guiding me through three Ultraman World Championships (’08, ’09 & ’11), EPIC5 in 2010 and the 2017 Ötillö Swimrun World Championships in Sweden this past September – which we raced together as a team.Today we discuss:On another note, I am looking to hire a filmmaker/photographer. As you may know, David Zammit joined me 2 months ago as my collaborative partner on video and photography projects. During this time, we made a fruitful leap to filming the podcast and created a few other cool pieces (with more on the way). Ultimately, the job turned out to not be the right fit for David, who returned home to Malta. For the record, I loved working with him.

November 19, 2017

“It appears that the consequences for truth are high.”Bryan Fogel Last week I sat down with Lance Armstrong to explore his competitive drive for greatness, precipitous fall from grace, and path forward. Irrespective of your opinion on Lance or that conversation, his story leaves us all with an indelible question:Just how far will we go to be considered the best?Obsessed with this inquiry, Bryan Fogel decided to answer it for himself.Struck by the fact that Lance never once failed a single drug test, the avid cyclist, playwright, and filmmaker decided to make a documentary with one goal in mind: to prove the system in place to detect doping athletes was bullshit.Because what the world watches on its sports fields should not be taken for granted as truth.Icarus was premised on an audacious idea: Bryan would undertake an aggressive doping protocol, experimenting with a wide variety of performance enhancing drugs. He would observe the changes in his athletic performance. He would attempt to evade detection. And finally, he would extensively and transparently document the entire experience, sharing the whole endeavor on film.To guide him through the mysterious and byzantine process of doping, Bryan enlists the professional aid of Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, a renegade Russian scientist and then pillar of his country’s “anti-doping” program. As they grow closer, it becomes clear that Rodchenkov is in fact the central figure in what we soon discover is Russia’s vast and elaborate state-sponsored Olympic doping program – a program that can be traced to Russia’s highest chains of command, all the way up to Vladamir Putin.When the two realize they hold the power to reveal the biggest international sports scandal in living memory, Bryan’s academic exercise in self-experimentation quickly pivots into spy thriller territory — a high-stakes and quite spectacular collision of politics, sports, espionage and danger more John LeCarré than Morgan Spurlock.Icarus premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, where it won “The Orwell” Special Jury Award and the first ever Audience Choice Award at Sundance Film Festival London. It’s been called a “game-changing documentary” by Variety and “The Best Non-Fiction film of 2017” by the Financial Times and was acquired by Netflix in a historic sale.Bryan and the story behind the film have been profiled in The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Financial Times, Variety , USA Today, Newsweek, The Atlantic, and The Guardian. Bryan has also discussed the film on NPR’s All Things Considered, NBC’s Meet The Press, ABC Dateline, Charlie Rose, Late Night with Seth Meyers, and Breakfast with the BBC.An extraordinary portrait of self sacrifice in the interest of truth, Icarus is a gripping exposé that will forever color your perception of Olympic sport. But more than that, it’s a palpable glimpse into the dark realpolitik of the global sports arena and the staggering implications it has on our already strained geo-political landscape.One of the best documentaries I have seen in recent memory, Icarus exemplifies the power of film to rewrite history.Today, Bryan joins me to share his fascinating tale.For the visually inclined, watch the podcast on YouTube.I sincerely hope you enjoy this exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

November 12, 2017

“If you ever get a second chance for something, you’ve got to go all the way.”Lance Armstrong Everyone has highs. Everyone has lows.But few people on Earth have experienced the unimaginable level of success enjoyed by this week’s guest.Fewer still have undergone a more precipitous fall from grace.What exactly is it like to go from global hero to pariah overnight?This is the story of Lance Armstrong.One of the most decorated, fiercely competitive and controversial figures of our age, today Lance joins the podcast to mine the depths of his infamous dismantling. We explore the demands required to rebuild his life. And together we consider his journey forward.But first, allow me to contextualize.I am well aware that Lance is polarizing. Emotions run hot. And nobody lacks an opinion. Perhaps you have been eagerly awaiting this conversation. Maybe you’re outraged. Either way, I get it. If you hold a strong opinion, this conversation isn’t likely to change that – nor is it my goal.As an athlete immersed in the culture of multi-sport who has closely followed the Lance story for as long as I can remember, I grasp and appreciate better than most the issues and controversy that swirl around the world’s most famous cyclist.This podcast is about exploring humanity in all its incarnations. More than anything, I’m interested in what makes people tick — why they do what they do; what they have gleaned from their experiences both good and bad; and how we can collectively grow from examining the lives of others.Among my favorite conversations are those with convicted murderer Shaka Senghor; registered sex offender Joseph Naus; felonious insider trader turned FBI informant Tom Hardin; and a battery of reformed reprobates that include alcoholics, drug addicts, and drug dealers. I state this not to draw any comparison whatsoever to Lance, but rather to illustrate my interest in the complex, dualistic nature of the human condition in all its incarnations.I too was once broken and lost. I cannot begin to compare my experience to that of Lance’s, but I do understand what it’s like to be dismantled. I know intimately what is required to confront and overcome one’s past. And I have great empathy for the degree of difficulty required to rebuild a life.It is with this spirit that I approached this conversation – not as an investigative journalist, nor as judge and jury. But rather, with heart open — my only agenda to have an honest dialog with one of the most prominent figures of our time.Of course, we discuss his iconic rise, fall and efforts to move forward. But I also endeavored to explore terrain beyond the scandals – subjects like mindset and preparation that often get eclipsed in the grand conversation about Lance.We talk about therapy. We explore his history with anger. And we delve into the evolution of his hyper-competitive nature.We discuss the differences between training as a professional cyclist versus his preparation for Ironman and other ultra-distance events.I asked him what it’s like to contend with a $100 million lawsuit hanging over his head. We discuss common mistakes many athletes make and how he would approach coaching young professional athletes. And finally, I gauge his thoughts on the future of clean sport.This is not the definitive Lance interview. We only had an hour. There were plenty of subjects I wish I had more time to explore. That said, I found Lance to be both open and demonstrative. I think you will be more than intrigued by the discussion.For the visually inclined, the video version of the podcast is also available on YouTube.I sincerely hope you enjoy this exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

November 9, 2017

“Every failure is actually a step forward. That’s how you learn to be who you are.”Mishka ShubalyDevoted listeners are well-acquainted with my gravelly voiced, chronically self-deprecating, often tortured, but always charming brother-from-another-mother Mishka Shubaly — back on the podcast for a record-breaking 8th appearance.A writer oozing talent from his overactive sebaceous glands, Mishka pens true stories about drink, drugs, disasters, desire, deception, and their aftermath.He began drinking at 13 and college at 15. At 22, he received the Dean’s Fellowship from the Master’s Writing Program at Columbia University. Upon receipt of his expensive MFA, he promptly moved into a Toyota minivan to tour the country nonstop as a singer-songwriter, often sharing the stage with comedians like Doug Stanhope and musical acts like The Strokes and The Yeah Yeah Yeahs.But mostly he drank.It sounds glamorous. It wasn’t. At 32, Mishka hit bottom, got sober and laced up a pair of running shoes. In between ultra marathons, he began publishing a string of #1 bestselling Kindle Singles – short non-fiction novellas — through Amazon. The Long Run*, his mini-memoir detailing his transformation from alcoholic drug abuser to sober ultrarunner, to this day remains one of the best-selling Kindle Singles in Amazon history.He is also the author of I Swear I’ll Make It Up To You*. Brutally honest, fiercely emotional and muscular in its prose, it’s the booze-fueled, opiated account of a precocious young underachiever trying to be good (and failing and failing) until one day he succeeds. It’s about serial abandonment, school shootings, alcoholism, loneliness, artistic frustration, faith, guilt, sobriety, running, relationships, resentment, revenge, music, art, and creativity. It’s about one man’s attempt to reckon with the wreckage of his past and his journey to reconcile his relationship with his family, and most importantly, to forgive the father that jettisoned him.It’s been over a year since Mishka dropped in on the pod to share his latest misadventures as a touring musician and tortured artist. We’re overdue for a check-in. And this conversation doesn’t disappoint. Even if you have listened to all 7 of our previous conversations, this one is sure to surprise and delight.We discuss alcoholism, nihilism and depression. We talk about how he maintains sobriety as a touring musician. We get into the romance of one’s drinking past and identity attachments that don’t serve us. And we cover the trading of one addiction for another.Most impactful is our discussion about Mishka’s recent diagnosis as pre-diabetic, and his decision to finally go plant-based. That is a sentence I never thought I would write.In response to my urging that Mishka get back to what he does best — writing — Mishka decided to crowd-source his oft-challenged motivation by launching a social media campaign designed to motivate all of us (but probably mostly him) to commit to spending a pre-ordained amount of time every single day in November to write. Join the brigade on twitter by posting your progress with the hashtag #writenovember.Finally, stick around to the end for a live musical performance by Mishka to take us out.I love Mishka like a brother. I love this conversation. I hope you do too.For those visually inclined, the video version of the podcast is also available on YouTube.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

November 5, 2017

“There are two kinds of cardiologists: vegans and those who haven’t read the data.”Dr. Kim Williams Heart health is serious business.Serious as a heart attack, as the saying goes, given that currently 1 out of every 3 people in America die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) – our #1 killer.According to the American College of Cardiology, CVD currently accounts for approximately 800,000 deaths in US. Among Americans, an average of one person dies from CVD every 40 seconds. Right now more than 90 million Americans carry a diagnosis of CVD. And over 45% of non-Hispanic blacks in the United States live with heart disease.But this isn’t just an American problem. On a global level, CVD is the single largest cause of death in developed countries and accounts for 31% of all mortalities.If you take a moment to ponder these staggering statistics, you quickly realize just how vast the epidemic of heart disease has become.And yet there is hope. Because this disease that’s debilitating and killing millions annually is entirely avoidable. It’s completely preventable. And it’s even reversible.The solution begins with personal responsibility. It’s about what you put in your mouth. It encapsulates your lifestyle choices. And it extends to erecting systemic changes in our health care model to prioritize prevention over symptomatic treatment.To walk us through these important issues I sat down with former American College of Cardiology president Kim Williams, M.D. — one of the most inspiring, intelligent and pioneering leaders in the growing movement to modernize how we think about, treat, avoid, and prevent our most onerous threat to human health.A graduate of the University of Chicago and the Pritzker School of Medicine, Dr. Williams currently serves as Chief of the Division of Cardiology at Rush University Medical Center, and is board certified in Internal Medicine, Cardiovascular Diseases, Nuclear Medicine, Nuclear Cardiology and Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. In addition to his tenure as President of the American College of Cardiology (2015-16), Dr. Williams has also served as the President of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology and Chairman of the Board of the Association of Black Cardiologists.Tangential fun fact? Dr. Williams was also a teen chess champion before becoming Illinois’ No. 3 singles tennis player at 15 years old with no previous background in the sport. Faced with a choice between pursuing professional tennis or medicine, he chose medicine.Back in 2003, Dr. Williams became concerned that his LDL cholesterol — the kind associated with an increased risk of heart disease — was too high. After some research into the positive benefits of adopting a plant-based diet, he decided to give it a shot. It worked, bringing his LDL down to normal levels. He then began prescribing his nutritional protocol to his patients. That worked too.Then an interesting thing happened. Dr. Williams became president of the American College of Cardiology, a 49,000-member medical society that is the professional home base for the entire cardiology profession. This gave him a broad platform of authority to advance awareness and the legitimacy of a plant-based diet as both a treatment and preventive protocol for heart disease.Today we unpack his story and probe the science, economics and politics behind nutrition and cardiovascular health on the road to avoiding, combating and ultimately overcoming America’s #1 killer. Specific topics covered include:This is a powerful and potentially life saving conversation. I hope you enjoy it. But more than that, I hope it impacts you to make better daily decisions concerning your health and well-being.For those visually inclined, the video version of the podcast is also available on YouTube.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

October 29, 2017

“Let us revere the one who loves others deeply, loves himself deeply, and has a dream that he is inspired to live with and by and through. He is a man.”Lewis HowesThe word authenticity has been so co-opted and commodified, it’s now almost impossible to use it without sounding hacky.But the sentiment behind the word remains beautiful. To me it means living honestly and with integrity. It means the courage and self-confidence to be open and vulnerable. It’s what it means to live, breathe and move in alignment with your truest, highest self.I do my best to live authentically. I strive to inject this sensibility into the content I create. And it’s a consistent theme of this podcast.Intellectually we understand the importance of living authentically. However, we all find ourselves — myself included — nonetheless projecting a version of ourselves onto the world. Not the raw truth but an edited impression of who we are and what we want others to see; a facsimile of identity, custom tailored to suit the expectations of our social environment.In other words, we all wear masks.We can characterize this behavior as dishonest. But it’s also just human. We’re all guilty to a certain degree.We do it because we’re afraid. Because we’re insecure. And because honesty and vulnerability are terrifying.If people really knew me, I would be unlovable.The impulse to hide our fears and flaws is normal. Not only is it easier to don a facade, it’s how we’ve been conditioned to behave for as long as we can remember. But when we inhabit the role we’ve been socially programmed to play at the cost our truest selves, we disconnect from both intimacy and ourselves, undercutting our ability to connect with others and inhabit the best of who we are are and what we have to offer.As counter-intuitive as it may sound, the more we can summon the courage to shed our masks – masks we have been wearing for so long and so persistently were not even consciously aware of them – in exchange for being open, honest, and vulnerable,  the more integrated, whole, secure, confident, and ultimately authentic we ultimately become.It’s scary. But overcoming this fear is the first step to truly blazing a path to becoming a fully integrated human. It’s the journey to becoming whole. At peace with yourself. Empowered. Self-actualized.And ultimately, free.This is the subject of today’s conversation. To shepard us through it is my friend Lewis Howes, host of the very popular School of Greatness Podcast, NY Times bestselling author of The School of Greatness*, and the man behind a brand new book hitting stores this week entitled The Mask of Masculinity: How Men Can Embrace Vulnerability, Create Strong Relationships, and Live Their Fullest Lives*.A former professional football player and USA team handball Olympic hopeful who bottomed out before blossoming into a successful online entrepreneur, Lewis defies the stereotype that typically accompanies most successful alpha males. With a glint in his eye, Lewis is warm, incredibly giving, and a stellar example of what life can be like when your heart is open — gratitude in motion.Lewis and I met close to five years ago, during the earliest days of our respective podcast journeys. Maturing in tandem, I’ve shared my perspective on his show twice and and this episode marks his third appearance on my show. I can honestly say this is the best, most open, dynamic and honest of his appearances on the RRP.This is a conversation about how our podcasting adventures have shaped our lives and careers. It’s also about the importance of storytelling as a catalyst for positive change.It’s an exploration of projection. It’s about why we wear the masks we do. It’s about why we don’t discuss that which evokes shame, and the fear that blocks our growth. And it’s about the freedom that can be experienced when you let go of that fear, release the shame, and own your truth.But at its core, this is a powerful exchange about the importance of embracing rather than repressing vulnerability — reframing it not as a weakness, but as a superpower.Because your ability to own your story and face your fears is your ultimately your greatest strength.NOTE: Although the focus of this conversation and Lewis’ new book is on the specific masks that men wear (redefining what it means to be truly masculine), the themes and topics explored are applicable to all.For those visually inclined, the video version of the podcast is also viewable on YouTube.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone who contributed to my charity: water birthday fundraising campaign. Together we have far exceeded my goal of raising $51,000. As of the date of this post, we have raised over $58,000 to bring clean water projects to those in need. To put this in proper perspective, that means that about 2,000 people will soon have access to clean water for the very first time, not counting future generations. In other words, you have literally breathed hope and life into communities, transforming their lives forever, which is about the coolest thing I can imagine. I couldn’t have done it without each and every one of you, so again I thank you, Scott Harrison thanks you, charity: water thanks you and everyone who will soon benefit from your generosity thanks you. The campaign will remain open through the end of this quarter, so if you would still like to contribute, you can. And there is good reason to — because right now 663 million people still live without clean water.

October 22, 2017

“Follow your bliss, not your material desires.”Dan Buettner We all want to be happy.But what exactly is happiness? Can it be cultivated? And if so, how?Somewhere along the way, you’ve likely heard of something called the Blue Zones — a term coined by this week’s guest in reference to five hidden slivers of the world that boast the highest per capita populations of centenarians – people who thrive to 100 and beyond. Unlikely locales where people not live inordinately long,Places where people forgot to die.Interestingly, in addition to outliving their fellow western world equals, the Blue Zoners also seemed resoundingly happier.Dan Buettner wanted to know more. So he shifted focus from longevity and zeroed in on the elusive, ever-so-slippery nature of happiness itself.Deploying his expertise and that of others, he used hard science to better define the emotional state we seek most. He scoured the planet in search of the cultures that most exemplify happiness. He examined the internal and external factors that most promote happiness. And he extrapolated the key lessons that can be best applied for us to all ultimately live better and more fulfilled.The result of Dan’s quest is the subject of today’s conversation. It’s also the the cover story of this month’s issue of National Geographic, the topic he explored all last week on the TODAY Show and the focus of his new Amazon #1 bestselling  book, The Blue Zones of Happiness: Lessons from the World’s Happiest People*.(full podcast on YouTube!)A true renaissance man, Dan is a National Geographic Fellow, a world adventurer with 3 endurance cycling world records to his name, a longevity expert, and a NY Times Bestselling author who has appeared on Oprah twice, as well as CNN, David Letterman, Good Morning America, Primetime Live, and the Today Show. He has delivered more than 500 keynotes over the last 10 years, including speeches for Bill Clinton’s Health Matters Initiative, Google Zeitgeist, and TEDMED. His TED Talk “How to live to be 100+” has been viewed over 3 million times.Long-time listeners will remember well our initial conversation. RRP 139 (April 2015) explored Dan’s fascinating, adventurous backstory and what he learned studying centenarians. This conversation picks up where that one left off to delve deep into the very nature of happiness. It’s about the three pillars that compose it. And the extent to which your environment and lifestyle choices impact your ability to exude and maintain it.It’s a conversation about what you can do to design your surroundings to stack the deck in favor of happiness. And it’s an exchange about the impact of Dan’s work on fundamentally improving health and happiness in cities and municipalities across the United States.But ultimately, this is a powerful primer on how to cultivate greater awareness around the choices we all make daily around food, lifestyle habits, and the quality of our physical and interpersonal environments. And it’s about how improving these choices can lead to the one thing we all seek – true, lasting happiness.I absolutely love this guy. A kindred spirit, he is truly is one of my favorite people. A man of grace and great integrity who is truly changing the world. A great mentor and role model — and an even better friend — I aspire to his level of service.And this conversation is simply great.For those visually inclined, the video version of the podcast is also viewable on YouTube.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

237,Rocco DiSpirito,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rocco-dispirito/,"Episode 321
October 15, 2017

“The Western diet is destroying our world and our lives and creating all these problems that we don’t need to have.” Rocco DiSpirito When it comes to food, we’ve been led to believe that healthy and delicious are mutually exclusive.When it comes to eating plant-based, forget about it. Most people can’t imagine their palate can possibly be sated without animal products.I’ve worked hard to bust this myth.But I’m no chef.Good thing today’s guest is.But Rocco DiSpirito is no ordinary chef. A James Beard award-winning culinary wizard, this guy is a straight up food genius.Named Food & Wine magazineʼs Best New Chef, People magazineʼs Sexiest Chef and the first chef to appear on Gourmet magazineʼs cover as Americaʼs Most Exciting Young Chef, Rocco is the author of 13 books (5 of which were NY Times bestsellers) who lorded over 3-Star restaurant Union Pacific, a New York City culinary landmark for many years (The New York Times deemed his dishes “pure genius”). Rocco skyrocketed to mainstream fame starring in a countless array of food and celebrity chef television shows, including NBC’s The Restaurant, ABC’s Extreme Weight Loss, Bravo’s Top Chef and Rocco’s Dinner Party, Restaurant Divided on Food Network — and even Dancing With The Stars.But it hasn’t been all roses. Along the way, Rocco faced much adversity. He’s battled detractors. And eventually his fast-paced, rich food-laden life caught up with him. By 38, Rocco had become seriously ill, boasting the metabolic rate of a 64-year old with an extra 40 pounds around the mid-section. His doctor told him he had no choice but to go on a battery of medications. But Rocco declined, setting his focus on healing himself with healthier food and physical exercise. It’s a path that forever altered his career and indeed his life — a re-imagination of great tasting food in service to well-being; to physical exercise and the world of triathlon; and more recently to exploring the healing benefits of a plant-based diet and the challenge of creating tantalizing recipes without meat and dairy.Ultimately, Rocco walked away from the cloistered sub-culture of New York City haute cuisine. It’s a move that puzzled the restaurant world, but Rocco was committed to leveraging his prodigious kitchen talents to help others achieve the vital wellness he now enjoys. Instead of opening up another bistro, he started coaching people. He launched an all-natural food product line. He founded a meal delivery service called The Pound A Day Diet. And he spends his free-time as an Ambassador for HealthCorps, visiting schools across the country performing cooking demonstrations and encouraging thousands of youth to build healthier habits.Indeed, it’s a laudable mission to prove that healthy and delicious can indeed coexist.Rocco’s more recent embrace of plant-based cuisine is what piqued my interest in sitting down with him. It’s also the thrust of his brand new cookbook, Rocco’s Healthy & Delicious: More than 200 (Mostly) Plant-Based Recipes for Everyday Life* hitting bookstores everywhere October 17.I love a good character arc. Charismatic and engaging, Rocco delivers in this super fun conversation with one of the world’s greatest chefs.We discuss the obstacles he met growing up modestly in a classic Italian-American household in Queens, New York, learning to appreciate the social applications of food from his mother — how making people feel loved became the why behind his how.A life-long student of culinary arts, we track Rocco’s career from pizza boy to the Culinary Institute of America at the young age of 16, his subsequent stints at some of the world’s greatest restaurants, his tenure at Union Pacific, and what it’s like to be a true celebrity chef.But mostly we focus on Rocco’s personal health journey — how he came to espouse the benefits of eating plant-based, the deleterious impact of the Western Diet on the planet and it’s people, and his unwavering commitment to helping others affordably access, achieve, and maintain true wellness.Pretty sure I made a friend with this one.

October 8, 2017

“It’s impossible to truly quantify the myriad of ways mushrooms can positively impact your life, yet they’re capable of doing all these things and so much more. Quietly, persistently, effectively.” Tero IsokauppilaWe tend to think of mushrooms as a pizza topping. Something we toss in a salad. Or a psychedelic to alter consciousness. But that’s pretty much where the inquiry ends.However, mushrooms are so much more. In fact, they comprise an entire kingdom. Invisibly surrounding us, they underpin the very foundation of our ecology, impacting us in ways far beyond our appreciation.It may surprise you to learn that mushrooms account for an astonishing 25% of the Earth’s total biomass. 92% of all plants are dependent upon mushrooms for their survival. 40% of all pharmaceuticals contain some form of mushroom. And, quite incredibly, 85% of human RNA and 50% of human DNA is shared with fungi.Mushrooms are also woefully under-appreciated when it comes to promoting health, fighting illness, buttressing longevity, enhancing memory and even boosting libido. Indeed, when properly understood and utilized, mushrooms hold the capacity to change your life in an immediate, powerful, and exponentially beneficial manner.To walk us through the magical and mysterious world of mushrooms, I sat down with my long-time friend Tero Isokauppila, the original fun-guy himself.(behind the scenes of my podcast with Tero)A life-long student of nutrition and expert on natural health hailing from Finland, Tero is the co-founder, president and marketing director of Four Sigmatic, the company behind a wide variety of very popular (and globally available) medicinal mushroom coffees, hot cacaos and elixir products that has successfully begun to introduce the health-promoting benefits of mushrooms to the mainstream.I’m not talking about mind-bending psychedelics. And I’m not talking about garden variety portobellos or even gourmet truffles. I’m talking about adaptogenic, superfood varieties most people have never previously heard of or know little to nothing about. I’m talking about less-understood immunity, longevity, and energy boosting fungi like reishi, chaga, lion’s mane, and my all-time favorite, cordyceps.Tero has been a featured speaker at events like Summit Series and Wanderlust, was chosen as one of the world’s Top 50 Food Activists by the Academy of Culinary Nutrition and both he and the work of Four Sigmatic have been profiled everywhere, including Vogue, Time, Forbes, W Magazine, Harper’s Bazaar, BuzzFeed, Bon Appétit, Goop, Well+Good, and MindBodyGreen.In addition, Tero is also the author of Healing Mushrooms: A Practical and Culinary Guide to Using Adaptogenic Mushrooms For Whole Body Health*, which hits bookstores everywhere Oct. 10. If today’s conversation sparks deeper interest, I highly suggest picking it up. Not only is it highly instructive, it include 50+ recipes sure to expand your culinary horizon.This is a phenomenal conversation that tracks Tero’s unique path from a kid foraging mushrooms in a 13th generation Finnish farming family to the entrepreneurial success he is today.It’s also fascinating deep dive into this mysterious mushroom kingdom and how these fungi can support human health. More specifically, we get granular on the individual adaptogenic properties of the most prominent superfood varieties and how incorporating them into your daily routine can take your health, longevity and performance to the next level.Finally, in gratitude for the opportunity to share his message, Tero wanted to provide a cool giveaway for five lucky RRP listeners he calls 120 Days on Shrooms — a 120-day gift package that bundles of my two favorite Four Sigmatic products: 4 boxes of their Cordycelps Elixir (amazing pre-workout); 4 boxes of their Mushroom Coffee with Lion’s Mane (this will light you up); plus a copy of Healing Mushrooms.To be entered in the giveaway, simply take a screen grab of this podcast episode on your mobile device or computer, post it on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, and hashtag it with #RichAndTero (don’t forget the hashtag – that’s how we will find your entry). The giveaway ends on October 10, so act fast. Finally, you must be a U.S. resident to enter for shipping purposes.DISCLOSURE: Fur Sigmatic has been a sponsor of the podcast in the past. I hope they will be a sponsor in the future. I love the company and support their mission. But this episode is not a paid sponsorship event. As previously mentioned, Tero and I go way back. I sought him out for this conversation. I receive nothing in return for this conversation and giveaway other than knowing you guys will benefit from listening. That said, I do have an affiliate relationship with the company.

239,Colin Hudon,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/colin-hudon-4/,"Episode 319
October 5, 2017

“Discipline is only difficult until it becomes a habit.” Colin HudonMan is a microcosm of the macrocosm. The nature that exists outside of us also lives within us. Separation is an illusion.Indeed, we are all intrinsically connected — to each other and the world that surrounds us. Embracing this fundamental truth lies at the core of ultimate well-being. Because true health doesn’t stop at the kale salad — it requires fidelity to our natural rhythms and a comprehensive, holistic devotion to bettering and balancing not just our physical bodies, but our mental, emotional, and spiritual selves as well.Returning to the podcast to walk us through this powerful law of nature is Colin Hudon.A gifted healer, physician of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Taoist Arts, Colin is also an herbalist, acupuncturist, tea master, and founder of Living Tea, an enterprise that finds Colin traveling across China, Taiwan, and Malaysia multiple times a year to source and import the finest and rarest old-growth teas and teaware in the world, sharing his expertise and wares in group tea ceremonies, with an eye on opening a tea house in Colorado in 2018.On point and remarkably instructive, this episode is lifted from Colin’s open dissertation conducted during our Plantpower Ireland retreat this past July.Most of us live lost in our heads. A predisposition that leaves us disconnected from ourselves, others, and the world. This is about transcending our addiction to thought and information, and how to leverage mindfulness and awareness to live healthier and more fully actualized.Colin also delivers an amazing primer on what we can glean from Traditional Chinese methods of medicine and healing. A perspective that begins with embracing seasonal rhythms to live in better alignment with the laws of nature.In addition, it’s also about tea. How tea, and the traditional ceremony around its enjoyment can serve as a powerful, moving meditation — an expression of living art that soothes the soul and enhances vitality.In anticipation of this episode, Colin was cool enough to create a special offer for listeners to purchase his amazing Living Tea (the only tea I drink) at reduced prices, including an awesome new subscription service called Tea Club, which takes the guesswork out of differentiating his exotic teas. When you sign up, Colin will send you the best seasonably appropriate, rare, old-growth teas (3-4 teas per season) quarterly, plus a bundle of extras, including information on the tea’s origin, optimal brewing techniques and Chinese medical philosophy on how to live a healthy, longevity focused life, including food suggestions and more. When you add the promo code RICHROLL at checkout listeners will get 12% off on your first season. In addition, if you follow Colin on Instagram (@livingtea) and click through the link in his bio to purchase you will also get 15% off on everything he has in stock.To learn more go to livingtea.net and click on Tea Club and sign up for his newsletter to be first in on future offerings and rebates. And should you happen to find yourself in the Denver area, I highly suggest you schedule a tea ceremony with Colin — as someone who has sat for tea with Colin many times, I can tell you it’s a transcendent experience.This is not an ad: I do not have any financial or professional association with Colin or Living Tea whatsoever. I do not have an affiliate relationship with Colin nor do I profit in any way from sharing this information. Simply put, people ask me all the time what tea I drink. I drink Living Tea because I honestly think it’s the best. And I wanted to make sure all of you know why and how to get it.Join us in Italy: If the Ireland retreat sounded cool (it was a giant blast), we are currently taking reservations for our next retreat. It will take place in Tuscany, Italy May 19-26, 2018. For more information and to reserve your spot, visit ourplantpowerworld.comLet’s get clean water to those in need: On October 20, I turn 51.

October 1, 2017

“If you’re worried about life-work balance, something is probably wrong with your life or your work. Instead of agonizing over balance, get excited and create change.” Chris Guillebeau Maybe you love your job. Perhaps you don’t.Either way, there’s wisdom in cultivating a side hustle — not a second job, but a self-styled income-generating project you cultivate in your free time.Why do I need this? Ask Choose Yourself!* author (and podcast guest) James Altucher and he’ll wax rhapsodic about the precarious nature of conventional career paths and the misplaced trust we invest in their long-term security. Invest in ownership. For some, the thought of quitting their day job to pursue the entrepreneurial life is exhilarating. For most, however, this is a terrifying prospect. And not everyone has the means or the desire to take on the risks and responsibilities of working for themselves.But Chris Guillebeau contends it’s not an either or scenario. Not only can you have both, you should. As traditional career trajectories give way to the rise of our freelance economy, it’s wise to diversify your income stream. But creating something on the side entirely your own isn’t just about extra cash. And it’s not really about becoming an entrepreneur (because most people aren’t). It’s also about cultivating purpose. It’s about elevating your sense of direction. And imbuing your path with greater personal meaning.A master of unconventional, purposeful living, Chris is a widely acclaimed author, blogger, entrepreneur and modern-day adventurer. Ripe with wanderlust after a 4-year stint as a NGO volunteer executive in West Africa, he embarked on a multi-year quest to travel to every country in the world, all 193, before his 35th birthday. Along the way, Chris began sharing his adventures on a newly hatched blog. What began as a rather ignored and somewhat turgid travelogue soon morphed into The Art of Non-Conformity, a globally revered portal that chronicles Chris’ personal experiences and the wisdom of a dynamic multitude of unconventional people overcoming conventional social mores around work, life and travel to achieve personal goals and greater life satisfaction outside traditional paradigms.Books soon followed. The Art of Non-Conformity* was translated into more than twenty languages. His second book, The $100 Startup*, was a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller, selling more than 500,000 copies worldwide. His third book, The Happiness of Pursuit*, was also a New York Times bestseller, followed by Born for This*, a primer to help you find the work you were meant to do.Chris is also the founder and ringmaster of the World Domination Summit, a truly spectacular annual gathering he founded seven years ago that brings thousands of creative, remarkable people together in his hometown or Portland, Oregon. I had the honor of being a keynote speaker at WDS this past summer and I can honestly say, as someone who has spoken at a lot of events, it was one of the most impressive and moving experiences of my life.This year, Chris launched Side Hustle School, a traveling workshop podcast series designed to help people create new sources of income without quitting your job. The kicker? He publishes new episodes every single day, seven days a week. Quick on the heels of the podcast is Chris’ brand new book, Side Hustle: Idea To Income in 27 Days*. Together, the book and podcast astutely tackle how and why we can all benefit from cultivating our creative, entrepreneurial flair in our free time.This is the subject of today’s conversation with one of my very favorite people.This is not about quitting your job to become a full-fledged entrepreneur. Instead, it’s about figuring out what you love and developing a practical way to convert it into passive income. It’s about why — even if you love your job — it’s important to supplement and diversify how you earn a living. And it’s about how this process can bring greater fulfillment into your every day life.For those new to the show, I urge you to also listen to my first conversation with Chris (RRP #247), a raw and real recount of Chris’ unique path and what it means to live an unconventional life and the power of divine moments.Finally, go behind the scenes of my conversation with Chris in IT ALWAYS GETS DONE, a little day-in-the-life movie shot and edited by the talented David Zammit. If you enjoy it, it would mean a lot if you subscribed to my YouTube channel at youtube.com/richroll.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

241,Gretchen Rubin,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/gretchen-rubin/,"Episode 317
September 24, 2017

“One of the best ways to make yourself happy is to make other people happy. One of the best ways to make other people happy is to be happy yourself.” Gretchen Rubin Today I sit down with New York Times bestselling author Gretchen Rubin to find out what happened when she asked a large number of people one singular question: how do you respond to expectations?The answers led Gretchen to an epiphany — that four distinct human tendencies intrinsically underlie how each and every one of us approach our interior and exterior lives. Understanding your tendency changes how you perceive yourself and others. It informs better communication. It provides the structure to create better habits. And ultimately it serves to support the purposeful pursuit of the personal and professional life experience you most seek.This is the terrain of today’s exploration.A member of Oprah’s Super Soul 100 who was named one of the Most Creative People in Business by Fast Company, Gretchen is an über-author who has sold over 3 million books on the subject of habits, happiness and human nature. You may know Gretchen from her wildly popular blog, her runaway bestseller The Happiness Project*, or from one of her other many titles such as Happiness At Home* and Better Than Before*. An exploration of the aforementioned architecture of human motivation, Gretchen’s new book is entitled The Four Tendencies: The Indispensable Personality Profiles That Reveal How To Make Your Life Better (and Other People’s Lives Better, Too)*.When she isn’t writing, Gretchen hosts the wildly popular Happier With Gretchen Rubin podcast (along with her sister, TV writer Elizabeth Craft), awarded “Best Podcasts of 2015” honors by iTunes and named one of the “Best Podcasts of 2016″ by the Academy of Podcasters (I didn’t even know podcasting had an academy, but there ya go).In addition, Gretchen is the creator of Better, a free mobile app that connects you with others to harness the Four Tendencies and create a better life.This conversation is jam packed with super helpful amazing takeaways.A former editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal who clerked for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, we track Gretchen’s leap from high-powered lawyer to pursue a career in writing.We talk about how her revelation about “expectations” led to The Four Tendencies, then unpack the specifics, tracking how these core archetypes can better inform our habits, our understanding of others and how we structure our professional and personal lives.I learned a lot about myself in this one. In fact, Gretchen has already helped me reframe certain aspects of how I approach myself and others.Final note: As you may recall, I put the word out a couple months ago in search of a partner to help create a visual arm to the work that I do. I think I found my guy. David Zammit, a young and talented photographer, editor and filmmaker from Malta, recently jumped aboard. Last week we posted a short film entitled Let’s Celebrate. Today we posted Where Do You Thrive? — a video that takes you behind the scenes of this very podcast. Our intention is to create at least a few videos every week. Soon we will be filming the entire podcast.

“We are all spiritual beings having a human experience.” Julie PiattAn open panel discussion on non-traditional healing modalities and how we conceptualize balance in the construct of our lives, this episode is lifted from a session that Julie Piatt and I conducted during our Plantpower Ireland retreat this past July.It features our long-time friend Colin Hudon, a physician of Traditional Chinese Medicine who is also the founder of Living Tea, which imports the finest living teas sourced from ancient tea trees across both China and Taiwan.Topics discussed include:Plus, we take some great questions and comments from our Plantpower tribe!This one veers towards the more esoteric, so please approach with an open mind. You might be surprised by the self-reflection it stimulates.One more thing: if the Ireland retreat sounded cool (it was a giant blast), we are currently taking reservations for our next retreat.

243,Phil Gaimon,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/phil-gaimon/,"Episode 315
September 17, 2017

“The biggest factor in who made it to the next level wasn’t talent or work ethic. It was a willingness to keep plugging away through all the hard times.” Phil Gaimon Let’s talk about doping.Throw cycling into the conversation and emotions are sure to run hot. It’s an emotional subject for reasons both obvious and obscure. A flashpoint that divides loyalties, pitting our innate sense of fairness against our natural impulse to forgive.I have opinions on the matter. But my perspective is far from set in cement. Because I am aware that it’s formed from the sidelines, as an observer of a very insular subculture beyond my direct experience, and to which I am not privy. Unless you were actually there — in the unfortunate and precarious position so many athletes across so many sports abruptly find themselves — my opinion is that we should not be so quick to judge.Everybody thinks they would make the right choice. I certainly do. But that’s just projection. The truth is that you don’t actually know what you would do. Connecting with this impulse helps me empathize with those who went astray. Is that a good thing? I honestly don’t know.Phil Gaimon did make the right choice. A somewhat polarizing figure in the cycling community, today he tells the tale.Overcoming childhood obesity to achieve his dream of riding professionally, over the course of his professional cycling career Phil competed on several established domestic teams like Jelly Belly, Bissel and Optum-Kelly Benefit as well as high profile, international UCI teams like Garmin Sharp in 2014 and Cannondale–Drapac in 2016 before hanging up his bib shorts at the end of last year. Well, not exactly, but I’ll get to that part in a minute.Along the way he has raced and trained with the best. Now he writes about his experiences, coming clean on what transpired behind cycling’s shrouded curtain with wit and a healthy dose of comedic self-deprecation. He is the author of Pro Cycling On $10 A Day* and Ask a Pro*. His newest tome, Draft Animals: Living The Pro Cycling Dream (Once In A While) — an entertaining memoir about achieving his childhood dream of riding pro on the World Tour and what happened to him when he achieved it — hits bookstores October 10, 2017.When he’s not writing books, Phil is an active blogger and contributor to various cycling publications like Velo News. He also hosts The Peloton Brief Podcast and is the founder of Phil’s Cookie Fondo – a series of cycling adventures between 32 and 113 miles taking place October 15 that showcases Malibu’s great climbs (and apparently involves a lot of cookies).Back to the bib shorts. He didn’t exactly hang them up. In fact, Phil has spent the better part of the last year pursuing what he calls The Worst Retirement Ever — an endeavor in which he is attempting to clock the fastest-ever recorded times on as many prestigious cycling climbs he can visit, both domestic and abroad — known as King Of The Mountain (KOM) honors on Strava, multisport’s most popular workout tracker social network. Motivated to reclaim all the KOMs held by previously banned riders, it’s a quest motivated by principle, for the sake of clean sport, and it’s a challenge he has been chronicling in a series of entertaining videos on YouTube.This is a conversation about his childhood growing up as an overweight kid. It’s about how he first started riding bikes to lose weight and how he turned his love of cycling into a career. We address the misconceptions of what it’s actually like to ride pro and we cover his more recent KOM adventures.And yes, we talk about doping — cycling’s sordid history with PEDs, the hows and whys behind Phil’s persistent refusals to dope, what it means to him to race clean and stay clean, and what he foresees for the future of the sport he loves.But at its core, this is a conversation that demystifies one of the world’s most unique, most colorful and most drama-riddled professional sports through the eyes of someone who actually lived through it.Final note: we recorded this conversation back in mid-April. Apologies to Phil and his fans that it took so long to publish this one — but hey I’m busy too. Along the way, Phil has since tackled a variety of new climbs, besting KOMs along the way.I enjoyed this one. I hope you do too.P.S. – Pretty sure I mispronounced Phil’s last name in the intro. It’s Guy-mon, not Gay-min. Inexcusable. Sorry about that Phil.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“My job is being a manager, cheerleader, salesperson and marketer for these plants that have saved my life.” Amanda Chantal BaconWhat do you become when your mom is the CEO of a prestigious fashion empire and your dad is a musician accompanying notorious acts like Billy Idol and the art punk group Suicide?You alchemize that business savvy with artistry. And pivot.Such is the tale of plant alchemist and holistic heroine Amanda Chantal Bacon — a wellness entrepreneur committed to the idea that food is equal parts art and medicine; as much about pleasure as healing; and that creativity and sustenance can be one and the same.A graduate of the New England Culinary Institute and former Food & Wine Editor at the LA Times, Amanda served apprentice duties under Suzanne Goin, the James Beard Award winning chef at the famous Luques Restaurant, who served as her mentor and inspiration behind Moon Juice, an online holistic apothecary and chain of elegant community-centric juice shops with three locations across Los Angeles that Amanda founded in 2012.Amanda is also the author of the exquisite Moon Juice Cookbook*, and has been profiled extensively in the most prestigious publications in the world, including the New York Times Sunday Magazine, The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Elle, Vogue, InStyle, and The Hollywood Reporter.In addition, Amanda is no stranger to controversy. Last year found her square in the Internet’s vicious, vitriolic crosshairs — an experience we explore at length.This is a conversation about Amanda’s eclectic upbringing and unique entrepreneurial path. It’s about taking control of your education and your path. It’s a conversation about self-care habits, and the power of plants to heal. And it’s about food not just as nourishment, but as an experience.Spending time with Amanda was soothing and delightful.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“This is our day. Now let’s make the best of it versus comparing ourselves to others or our expectations.”Chris HauthToday I am joined by my friend, coach and teammate Chris Hauth for a special edition of Coach’s Corner – a spin on my typical podcast format — to recap our breathtaking, once-in-a-lifetime adventure competing in the Ötillö Swimrun World Championships in Sweden.A sub-9 hour Ironman, Chris (@AIMPCoach) is a former professional triathlete, two-time Olympic Swimmer and one of the world’s most respected endurance coaches. In 2006, Chris won the Ironman Coeur D’Alene and went on to be the first American amateur & 4th overall American at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii.When he’s not training and racing, Chris runs AIMP Coaching, mentoring a wide spectrum of athletes ranging from elite professionals — including Ironman and Western States top finishers, Ultraman winners and Olympic Trials qualifiers — to first time half-marathoners. Under Chris’ tutelage since 2008, he deftly guided me through three Ultraman World Championships, EPIC5. and now Ötillö.This past Monday, Chris and I joined 300 athletes from 24 countries to race Ötillö as a two-man team, traversing 26 islands spread across the outer-reaches of the Swedish archipelago on foot and by sea. All told, 40 miles of running and 6 miles of swimming.It was a truly extraordinary experience. Punishing. Humbling. Brutal, beautiful and beyond extreme.Along the way we met gale force winds. Sideways rain. Bone-chilling Baltic waters. And six-foot swells. We were on our hands and knees, scaling vertical granite slippery as ice. We trudged through bogs in knee-deep mud. Loose rocks left us flat on our backs. We bushwhacked terrain so difficult, so impossibly technical, it all feels now like an impossible dream.Today we share the incredible story.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Live a life filled with wonder and curiosity. Ask questions.”Drew SamsI don’t consider myself religious.But I am spiritually curious; deeply interested in faith.From Sikh kundalini master Guru Singh and Buddhist monk / tea master WuDe to iconoclast Christian pastor Rob Bell, the exploration of faith in its varying incarnations has been a fascinating, recurring theme of this show.Today, I continue the tradition with Dr. Drew Sams, senior pastor and head of staff at Bel Air Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles.Hardly conventional, Drew is many things. Life-long surfer. Avid ultra-runner. Passionate environmentalist. Devoted family man deeply interested in social justice, nutrition, and wellness. And a progressive doctor of divinity with a take on the Christian faith that is inspiring audiences in Los Angeles and across the world.I think Jesus was an extraordinary guy. But I freely admit that conversations on the subject of organized religion can leave me queasy. Perhaps it’s my personal baggage. I don’t know. But I do know I really enjoyed this particular exchange — grounded and relatable, Drew made it fun.Today I unpack this pastor’s personal journey to faith. It’s a conversation about Drew’s evolving perspective on God and Christianity.It’s about the distinction between literal, allegorical and personal interpretations of the Bible.It’s about the relationship between faith, consumerism and environmentalism.It’s a conversation about masculinity — cultural ideation around what a man “should be” versus the strength that can be mined through compassion & emotional vulnerability.But mostly it’s an engaging exchange about our collective moral responsibility to ourselves, our fellow humans, and the planet at large.Drew was great.So let’s talk to a pastor!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“We are defined more by our response to something than what happens to us.” Samantha Gash  Imagine running a 250 kilometer ultramarathon across the Atacama desert — one of the driest places on Earth — when your only legit running experience is a single ill-fated marathon attempt that left you humbly walking the last eight miles.That same calendar year, you race three more 250km ultramarathons to become the first female and youngest person to ever run and complete the 4 Desert Race Series Grand Slam, one of the world’s toughest and most prestigious endurance achievements imaginable.This is inspiring story of Samantha Gash — ultra-athlete extraordinaire, roll model, humanitarian, and just a really cool person.Discovering a previously unbeknownst acumen for endurance and a disposition for suffering unlocked a certain joy in Samantha, as well as a thirst for more. So the year following her 4 Deserts achievement, she conquered a 222km non-stop foot race across the Himalayas at 6,000 meters above sea level — an event that had only been completed previously by one man.That experience triggered a deep desire to leverage her running for humanitarian causes. So she got to work, running and raising money for causes she believed in. Among her accomplishments:Amidst the insanity of it all, she somehow managed to raise over $203,000 and counting for the aforementioned causes.Today we unpack Samantha’s extraordinary, inspiring journey, blisters and all.This is a phenomenal conversation about Samantha’s transformation from someone with no athletic background into the inspiring ultra-athlete humanitarian she is today. From all the hardships and seemingly insurmountable setbacks and obstacles to the rare air she occupies today, it’s a story about self-belief, purpose, perseverance and the call to service.But the core theme of today’s conversation is the close kinship that exists between passion and suffering. And the magic that transpires when you have the willingness to entertain the impossible, step outside your comfort zone and courageously leap through fear into the abyss.Sam is an absolute delight. It was a privilege to spend a few hours with her and boyfriend Mark Wales, a badass Australian Special Ops Commander she met when they were both contestants on Australian Survivor.You’re gonna love this one.

“We don’t get burned out by what we do… We get burned out because we forget why we’re doing it.” Jon Gordon It’s never too late to transform your life.I didn’t find my place in the world until my mid-40’s.Similarly, this week’s guest risked his successful but deeply unfulfilling business to pursue his truth as a speaker and author.I’m glad I took that leap of faith. In truth, I can’t imagine my life otherwise.Jon Gordon not only feels the same, he believes everyone holds the power to transcend their circumstances and blaze a purposeful life of meaning.This week I sit down the celebrated bestselling author and prolific keynote speaker to discuss what it takes to cultivate that vision and the commitment required to manifest untapped reservoirs of human potential. What holds most people back. And the specific steps required to break the glass ceiling on performance and potential in career, sport and life.A graduate of Cornell University with a masters in teaching from Emory, Jon Gordon has inspired millions of readers and audiences around the world with highly instructive teachings on the themes of leadership, human potential, teamwork and positivity – principles that have been beneficial to many a Fortune 500 company — such as GE, Wells Fargo, State Farm, Campbell Soup, Dell, Publix, and Southwest Airlines — and a litany of professional and collegiate sports teams, including The Los Angeles Dodgers, The Atlanta Falcons, LA Clippers, Miami Heat, Pittsburgh Pirates, Clemson Football and more. Jon also impacts thousands of teachers and students each year through his work with schools, universities like West Point, hospitals and non-profit organizations.Jon has been featured on The Today Show, CNN, CNBC, The Golf Channel, Fox and Friends, in numerous magazines and newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, and he is the author of an astounding 17 books, including 5 bestsellers: The Energy Bus*, The Carpenter*, Training Camp*, You Win in the Locker Room First* and The Power of Positive Leadership*. This isn’t just a conversation about success — it’s about finding fulfillment and purpose in every hour of every day.It’s about how he cultivates, nurtures and practices the prolific creativity required to write 17 books.It’s about the core leadership and teamwork principles he teaches that have positively impacted a litany of professional athletes, coaches, organizations, students, teachers, schools, corporations, and non-profits.It’s a conversation about the primacy of positivity – how to confront negativity (“Energy Vampires”) and convert it to positivity.It’s about commitment, service, and the importance of culture within an organization.And it’s a conversation about the importance of discovering your North Star — defining what motivates you and summoning the commitment to execute on that vision.It was an absolute delight to spend a couple hours with this extraordinary man and I think our exchange reflects my enthusiasm.I sincerely hope you enjoy the discussion. More importantly, my hope is that you implement the many takeaways into your life in a meaningful way.Because it’s never too late to transform your life.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

One of the funnest people you will ever meet, Burks is a former Olympic medalist in swimming from the University of Florida, where she was a 23-time All American swimmer, won 2 individual NCAA titles (200 free & 500 free) and was named 2008 NCAA Female Swimmer of the Year. In addition to breaking the oldest then standing women’s NCAA record in the 500 free (with a blazing 4:33), she earned a Bronze medal in the 4×200 free relay at the 2008 Olympics.Caroline has a Masters of Science in Sports Psychology & Motor Behavior from the University of Tennessee and when she’s not training like crazy, she works with young athletes under RISE Elite Athletes, a company she founded that pairs Olympic athletes with young athletes for mentorship and guidance.Today we sit down for a brief (by the standards of this podcast) check in from Lake Tahoe — site of our recent high altitude training camp — for a state-of-the-union on our preparation for the Ötillö Swimrun World Championsips, just 18 days from the date of this posting.Within the frame of this conversation you also will find a number of helpful fitness, training and general wellness takeaways germane to the listener — whether you are an elite athlete, a weekend warrior or just looking for that nudge to get off the couch.Specific subjects discussed include:I could have never achieved the level of athletic success I have enjoyed without Chris’ deft counsel, so it is with pleasure that I share his wisdom & Caroline’s wit with you today.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

August 13, 2017

“Spirituality untested and unchallenged is a sword made of tin foil. True steel is forged in the fire of resistance.”Aubrey MarcusExperimentalist. Unconventional fitness junkie. Entrepreneur. Human optimizer. Psychonaut.This week’s guest defies any singular title. But the underlying ethos that defines Aubrey Marcus is best captured in one brief phrase:Warrior Poet.On the business front, Aubrey is the CEO of Onnit –– an optimal human performance company he founded just six years ago that has grown to one of the INC 500 top 500 fastest growing companies in America. Offering a wide array of products, Onnit produces supplements for cognition, mood, bone and joint function; fitness equipment such as kettle bells and jump ropes; personal care products; and foods that range from Himalayan salt to coffee. Online, the Onnit Academy boasts copious helpful information on all things human optimization. And if you visit Onnit HQ in Austin (where we recorded this conversation), you’ll find a cutting edge training center & ju jitsu studio that many an elite athlete call home, including Super Bowl champion football players, Stanley Cup winning hockey players, Olympic gold medalists, and mixed martial arts champions.On top of being a very active CEO, Aubrey hosts both the Total Human Optimization Podcast as well as The Aubrey Marcus Podcast, both dedicated to exploring and expanding human happiness and consciousness.The accomplishments are impressive. But what truly interests me about Aubrey is his uniquely mystical path to success. His philosophical perspective on the human experiment. His uncommon devotion to continued expansion of consciousness. And his unusual blend of alpha male masculinity with esoteric spirituality.This is a conversation that examines the metaphysical intangibles that catalyzed Aubrey’s unusual path. It’s about self-worth, self-love and self-discovery — and why outward success is always an inside job.But mostly this is a conversation about what it means to be human. To live meaningfully. And with purpose.I think it’s safe to say that Aubrey and I are very different people. But I think that makes this conversation special.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

August 6, 2017

“There was a time when you believed anything was possible and I want to bring people back to that. And I think the mountains do that.”Lynsey Dyer Imagine being the very best in your sport. Undefeated, the future is bright indeed. But deep down the zero sum game of competition just doesn’t sit right. Because for you, sport isn’t about winners and losers. It’s about play. It’s about freedom. It’s about love.But mostly it’s about artistic self-expression.This is the story of Lynsey Dyer.One of the best big mountain skiers on the planet, Lynsey is an extraordinary and most unexpected athletic talent who walked away from competition at the peak of her potential to courageously blaze her own path. A unique path that has helped refine what it means to pursue sport professionally. A path based not on podiums but on adventure. Seeking joy. Empowering others. And expressing one’s unique voice.Over the course of a decade long career, Lynsey has won every big mountain competition that she entered. She has also won several freesking competitions and awards including the 2004 International Free Skiers Association North American tour champion. In 2010, Powder Magazine awarded her Best Female Performance for her role in Magic Moments*. She has been awarded Female Skier of the year by Powder Magazine, was the first female to be on the cover of Freeskier Magazine and has starred in too many ski films to mention, including projects from legendary filmmaker Warren Miller.Lynsey has starred in or hosted television shows for NBC, ESPN, Bravo, The Ski Channel, Mountainfilm and Outside Television, has appeared on Good Morning America and even produced, directed and starred in her own film, the widely acclaimed Pretty Faces — an all female ski film featuring the best athletes from around the world that beautifully celebrates female empowerment and the transformative power of play. When she isn’t crushing powder, Lynsey can be found running her non-profit SheJumps.org, which encourages girls and women to participate in the outdoors through mentorship, and her movie production and apparel company Unicorn Picnic.An unconventional badass, Lynsey is the personification of strength in femininity. A role model for young women across the world with an ethos I’d like my own daughters to emulate.This is a conversation about Lynsey’s remarkable life. It’s about female impact on a male dominated subculture. It’s about courage in defying external expectations to follow your own unique path. It’s about the joy and freedom that come from blazing a life of adventure.Simply put, it’s a conversation about what it means to pursue sport as art.It was a pleasure connecting with Lynsey.

“Wherever you are in life, ask yourself: what am I doing, why am I doing it and is it in the highest divine alignment with my authentic blueprint?”Julie Piatt Excerpted from the first day of our recent Plantpower Ireland retreat, this special mid-week episode of the podcast is a dynamic Q&A session focused on the process of self-inquiry necessary to objectively asses your life — a condition precedent to birthing expression to an authentic, purpose-fueled path premised on the values you hold most dear.To place this conversation in proper context, the Q&A was preceded by a lengthy discussion (which I decided to not include so as not to overwhelm) on three fundamental questions specifically intended to help frame the assessment process:Journaling on the aforementioned is a powerful, highly recommended exercise for anyone seeking greater self-actualization. And this Q&A is an interactive discussion about the hows and whys that underpin these queries.

“I think there’s a real freedom that comes with service, but so many people are enslaved in the service of themselves.”Scott Harrison From the outside looking in, he was living the dream.Killer SoHo loft. Private jets to exotic locales. Rolex, cover model girlfriend and cash. Plenty of cash.But ten years living decadently and extravagantly as a nightclub promoter in New York City took it’s toll.By 28, Scott Harrison had become the worst person he knew.Utterly lost, mired in a crisis of conscience and desperate to rediscover his sense of purpose, Scott decided it was time for a drastic change. So he left NYC to spend a year volunteering as a photojournalist aboard a hospital ship off the coast of Liberia, West Africa.During this time, Harrison witnessed and photographed levels of poverty and illness he never knew existed. As one year turned into two, he came to understand that many of the infections and diseases their group treated were waterborne, and could have been prevented if people had access to clean drinking water. Scott couldn’t understand why nobody seemed to be focusing on solving this important problem at scale. So he decided to tackle it himself.Upon returning to NYC in 2006, Scott turned his full attention to the global water crisis and the (then) 1.1 billion people living without access to clean water. The manifestation of that commitment is charity:water — a revolutionary for-purpose endeavor that to date has raised over $210 million to fund an astounding 20,000+ water projects that deliver clean water to more than 6.3 million people all across the world.Equally impressive is the extent to which Scott has quite literally reinvented and re-energized how we give and how we think about giving. He did it by creating an aspirational brand. He did it by restoring public trust in charity. And he did it by leveraging technology to deeply connect each and every giver with the gift’s specific result and impact.Simply put, Scott Harrison is one of the most impressive people I have ever met. His inspiring story from lost to found is legend.I’m thrilled to share it with you today.My hope is that this conversation inspires action. Because each and every one of us holds the power to positively impact the life of another. And because life is more fulfilling, meaningful and rewarding when we are persistently engaged in the pursuit of service and giving.My call to action? The Spring — charity: water’s monthly subscription service. I signed up. And you should too. 100% of all Spring donations go directly to the field to bring clean water to those in need, and Spring members will get updates of the impact their donations have.Let’s all pitch in together. As a community. Because even a simple $30 gift can provide one person with clean water. And because it’s just cool and awesome to do generously for others.For more information and to sign up, visit our special url cwtr.org/richrollspring or click the banner ad below.This is a special one for me.

July 23, 2017

“What we consume as humans should be taken very seriously.”Dominick ThompsonWhen did we decide it’s “manly” to repress our emotions, oppress the weak and deny our shared humanity?Somewhere along the way the aspirational qualities of masculinity have been denuded by a cultural perversion of the gender norm.Because caring and compassion should not be gender specific.This week on the podcast I sit down with my friend Dominick Thompson to reclaim the best of what it means to be truly masculine. Because there is nothing more manly than demonstrating compassion over dominance. Protection over prey. Restraint over force. Understanding over judgment. And love over bigotry.A leading voice in the vegan & plant-based athlete communities, Domz is an athlete, activist, and the founder of NYC-based start up Crazies and Weirdos — hip, sustainable and eco-friendly clothing made from recycled and organic materials.  He is also the founder of Iron Brukal, a sports and fitness brand dedicated to the working professional, with plans to open training facilities in 2019.Prior to becoming a social entrepreneur and activist, Dominick was a healthcare executive responsible for the business development and management of hospital systems and other providers across the eastern region of the United States. A working athlete, Dominick’s intense training schedule includes cycling, swimming, running, calisthenics, boxing, cross-fit, cross-training, weight and power-lifting. He competes in 10-12 endurance races per year, including marathons, triathlons, and ultra-races.Dominick has been recognized for his activism across a variety of major news outlets, including NPR News, ABC News, Men’s Muscle and Fitness Magazine, Esquire, Thrive Magazine, Origin Magazine, PETA.com and more. Online, Dominick activates his 159,000+ Instagram followers with a pull-no-punches mix of brutal truth education with relatable, uplifting inspirationBehind the social media and accolades, there is far more to Dominick Thompson than meets the eye. A potent, at times harrowing tale, Domz’s narrative is one of unfortunate circumstance. scarring incarceration and a most unlikely redemption.It’s also a story never previously told.Until now.I appreciate Dom’s trust and the opportunity to help share his life account. A powerful, must listen episode, this is a conversation about hope and belief. It’s about a healthy conceptualization of masculinity and the responsibilities that role entails. It’s about the resolve required to transcend the victimhood of circumstance. And it’s about rebirth into a purposeful life of meaning and service.Survivor. Role model. Hero. Awesome human being. Good friend. Domz is the genuine article. And today he delivers the goods.I sincerely hope you enjoy this powerful, much-anticipated exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“If you have ever had one single thought that you wanted something more for your life, please heed that thought. I believe it is the voice of your own heart asking you to become whole again.”Tommy RosenAddiction doesn’t discriminate. It doesn’t care how smart you are or how much money you have. Left unchecked, it will destroy your career, decimate your relationships, asphyxiate your aspirations and ultimately bankrupt your soul until you are but a shell of a human being — totally lost, devoid of hope and utterly alone.I’ve been there. Tommy Rosen has been there too.By the grace of a power greater than ourselves, both Tommy and I found a way out. A solution for sobriety that slowly pieced us back together, made us whole and gave our lives purpose.That solution is the focus of today’s conversation.With over twenty-four years of continuous sobriety, Tommy is an addiction recovery expert who has spent the last two decades immersed in yoga, recovery and wellness.He is the author of Recovery 2.0: Move Beyond Addiction and Upgrade Your Life&*, and the founder and host of the Recovery 2.0: Beyond Addiction Online Conference. In addition, he holds certifications in both Kundalini and Hatha Yoga and leads Recovery 2.0 retreats and workshops internationally and presents regularly at yoga conferences and festivals.This is a conversation about Tommy’s remarkable path to recovery.It’s an intense and at times profound discourse on the ravages of addiction and alcoholism.And it’s a master class on the healing journey to becoming whole through the lens of Tommy’s expertise, which is utilizing yoga and meditation to empower people to free themselves from the prison of addiction and ultimately build purposeful, fulfilling lives.If you are suffering from some form of addiction, this episode is a must listen. Even if you’re not an addict, I encourage you to embrace this conversation as a means to better understand the affliction, as chances are you probably know someone in need of help,I sincerely hope you enjoy this powerful exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

July 9, 2017

“Our generation must fulfill the most noble of duties by ensuring the survival of future generations through the most basic of survival mechanisms – adaptation.”Leilani MünterIf you want provoke change — real change — it’s imperative to take a stand outside the echo chamber of the converted.That’s the ethos of professional race car driver and environmental activist Leilani Münter.Named one of the top ten female race car drivers in the world by Sports Illustrated, Leilani races in NASCAR’s ARCA Series and is the fourth woman in history to race in the Indy Pro Series (the development league of IndyCar). She has logged impressive performances at both Daytona and Talladega and set the record for the highest finish for a female driver in the history of the Texas Motor Speedway when she finished fourth in 2006.But what’s most intriguing about Leilani — beyond the inherent intrigue of being one of the only female drivers in her sport — is her singular commitment to leveraging her profile to educate, inspire and raise awareness around environmental issues.Winning isn’t everything. Change is the goal.Putting her money where her mouth is, Leilani has foregone traditional sponsorship opportunities to race cars draped in oversized logos promoting the documentaries The Cove and Blackfish. At Daytona in February 2017, she raced a car displaying Vegan Powered bills across the hood and sides. And since 2007, she adopts one acre of rainforest for every race she runs.Leilani has presented before the UN in Geneva in 2015 and has appeared on Capitol Hill to speak on behalf of clean energy legislation. In addition, she was one of the first activists to arrive at the 2010 Gulf oil disaster and traveled to Taiji, Japan three times to document the dolphin slaughter depicted in the Academy Award winning documentary The Cove. She sits on board of the Oceanic Preservation Society and on the advisory board of The Solutions Project, a nonprofit dedicated to accelerating the transition to 100 percent renewable energy.Leilani appears in the 2015 documentary Racing Extinction and her accomplishments have been profiled in USA Today, Italian Vogue, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Reader’s Digest, Esquire, and Newsweek. Discovery’s Planet Green named Münter the No. 1 eco-athlete in the world, she is a recipient of ELLE Magazine’s 2012 Genius Award, and Glamour Magazine named her an “Eco Hero.”This conversation explores Leilani’s upbringing, what motivated her to become a race car driver, and what its like to be one of the only females in her male dominated sport.It’s a discussion about the intersection of activism and sport — how Leilani infuses performance with her strident commitment to principles.But mostly this is a conversation about the why behind Leilani’s drive. A strong, powerful female role model committed to positively impacting culture, shifting consumer habits and catalyzing beneficial environmental policy change, I aspire to her level of dedication to a better world.As Leilani is fond of saying, never underestimate a vegan hippie chick with a race car.After this conversation, you won’t either.I love this exchange and sincerely hope you do too.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

July 2, 2017

“That’s the thing about hope. In the moment it can feel foolish or sentimental or disconnected from reality. But hope knows that people change on a timeline that we can’t predict. We can never know the power that a word of kindness and or an act of forgiveness will have on the person who needs it most.”Shaka SenghorImagine yourself growing up around the wrong people. Because it’s easy, you fall into the wrong crowd. Blink, and you’re in. Deep. A victim of impossible circumstances, it’s not long before you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time. In the reflexive moment — impulsively and without thought – you do the wrong thing. A thing so terrible, it forever alters the trajectory of your life. A thing so unimaginably horrible, you dedicate the rest of your life in service to atonement.This is the story of Shaka Senghor. At the age of 19, Shaka shot and killed a man. Convicted of second-degree murder, Shaka would spend the next 19 years in different prisons, seven of which were spent in solitary confinement.While inside, Shaka made a decision. A decision to fully own his circumstances. A decision to transcend victimhood, understand his past, free his mind and expand his thinking. When he wasn’t voraciously reading, he wrote. And it was through this relentless commitment to knowledge, self-understanding and compassion that he ultimately pulled himself out of the anger that led to his incarceration and prevented him from reaching his full potential.Released in 2010, Shaka did not return to a life of violence. Instead, he committed himself to one singular idea: that our worst deeds don’t define who we are, nor do they prohibit our contribution to a better world. Fidelity to this ideal transformed Shaka’s utterly broken life into one of meaning, purpose and advocacy. Now a leading voice in prison reform, he is a powerful public speaker, a Senior Fellow with the Dream Corps, a 2014 TED Prize finalist, a former MIT Media Lab Director’s Fellow, a former University of Michigan lecturer, a current Fellow in the inaugural class of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation’s Community Leadership Network and the founder of The Atonement Project. In addition, he recently launched Mind Blown Media, a new media company that aims to create high-impact content focused on the criminal justice system and mass incarceration.Shaka’s memoir, Writing My Wrongs: Life, Death and Redemption in an American Prison* debuted on The New York Times Best Seller List as well as The Washington Post Best Seller List. He has been interviewed by Oprah and his TED Talk, which received a standing ovation, has been viewed more than 1.4 million times and was featured by TED as one of the most powerful TED Talks of 2014. Shaka has appeared on CNN, CBS This Morning, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Good Day New York, and he has been a guest on numerous radio programs, including NPR’s All Things Considered. And if all that isn’t impressive enough, Shaka is the recipient of numerous awards, including the 2016 EBONY Power100, the 2016 Ford Man of Courage, the 2016 NAACP Great Expectations Award, the 2015 Manchester University Innovator of the Year, and the 2012 Black Male Engagement Leadership Award.I’m honored to share Shaka’s powerful story with you today. It’s a story about what it takes to truly turn your life around. It’s a story of what’s required to overcome impossible circumstances, childhood trauma, drugs, gun violence and crime. And it’s a story about atonement — the hard-fought journey to redemption, forgiveness, gratitude and service.At times intense and haunting, my hope is that our conversation will stick with you. Catalyze you to think more broadly about your past harms. Inform how you can better conduct yourself moving forward. And inspire you to invite more gratitude, advocacy and forgiveness into your own life.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

June 25, 2017

“You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, and that person is not to be found anywhere. You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.”Sharon SalzbergWe all yearn for connection, yet often feel trapped by our sense of isolation, anger, or envy. But there is a key that can free us from this prison of despair.Love.The problem? Love is just hard to talk about. Harder to understand. And perhaps even harder to practice.How we get it? How we give it? How do we attract it? How do we cultivate it?To answer these questions, first we have to define it.What is love, exactly? Ask Sharon Salzberg and she’ll tell you that it’s not an emotion we should be trying to extract from another. In fact, don’t even think about love as a feeling at all. Instead, consider it as an ability. An aptness or facility that resides within all of us that can be cultivated to create real, profound connections with others, with all, and most importantly ourselves. And it is that connection that will nourish the very sustenance of life itself and ultimately set you free.Today I sit down with Sharon to redefine our limited interpretation of love. To dispel the misunderstandings that confine and circumscribe it. To plumb the eternal truths within it — love based on direct interactions rather than preconceptions. And to explore how we can better cultivate and expand our experience of real love in our daily lives.For the uninitiated, Sharon Salzberg is a towering figure in the field of meditation. A world-renowned teacher and multiple New York Times’ bestselling author, she has played a central, crucial role in bringing meditation and mindfulness practices to the West and into mainstream culture dating back to 1974 when she first began teaching. She is the co-founder of the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, MA and the author of ten books, including the New York Times bestseller, Real Happiness*, her seminal work, Lovingkindness* and her newest release, Real Love: The Art of Mindful Connection* (the focus of today’s conversation). Sharon is also a regular columnist for On Being, a contributor to Huffington Post, and the host of her own podcast, The Metta Hour.One of the many striking things about Sharon is that she’s just cool. Like, really f*$king cool. Despite her undisputed luminary status in the meditation space, conspicuously absent is any hint of pretense or artifice. Down-to-earth and fun to be with, her approach to Buddhist teachings is modern, secular, and accessible, rendering the wisdom and it’s practical applications relatable to all.This conversation is a deep dive into Sharon’s extraordinary life. It’s about the reoccurring abandonment and incomprehensible trauma she endured as a child — and how she ultimately found salvation, and her life path, in meditation.It’s a discussion about how we think about and practice love – love for others, love for all, and love for one’s self.It’s about unconscious pain and the inherent value of suffering when recognized and properly channelled.It’s about the three most essential life skills – compassion, mindfulness & concentration – and how meditation can help us master them by training our attention.And it’s a conversation about the imperative of navigating these treacherous, divided times with fierce compassion and unabated loving kindness.It was an absolute blast spending a couple hours with Sharon, and I think you’ll really love (pun intended) the product of our exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“There are so many things that your body gives you clear signals for – you just need to understand the language it’s speaking.”Chris HauthToday I am joined by Chris Hauth for round two of my new and novel Coach’s Corner edition of the podcast.A sub-9 hour Ironman, Chris (@AIMPCoach) is the current Age Group Ironman World Champion, a former Olympic Swimmer and one of the world’s most respected endurance coaches. In 2006, Chris won the Ironman Coeur D’Alene and went on to be the first American amateur & 4th overall American at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii.When he’s not training and racing, Chris coaches a wide spectrum of athletes ranging from elite professionals — including Ironman and Western States top finishers, Ultraman winners and Olympic Trials qualifiers — to first time half-marathoners.A friend and mentor as much as a coach, Chris has deftly guided me through three Ultraman World Championships (’08, ’09 & ’11), EPIC5 in 2010 and is currently preparing me for the impending Ötillö Swimrun World Championships in Sweden this September, an event we will race together — literally tethered to each other — as a team.Today we sit down for a brief (by the standards of this podcast) state-of-the-union on our training at 11 weeks out from Ötillö, then shift focus to a number of fitness, training and overall wellness subjects germane to the listener — whether you are an elite athlete, a weekend warrior or just looking for that nudge to get off the couch.Specific subjects discussed include:I could have never achieved the level of athletic success I have enjoyed without Chris’ deft counsel, so it is with pleasure that I share his wisdom with you today.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

Cheese is both…Loaded with calories, high in sodium, packing more cholesterol than steak, and sprinkled with hormones — if cheese were any worse, it would be Vaseline.” Neal Barnard, M.D.     Last week we discussed the how behind ditching dairy. This week we discuss the why.Right now the average American eats more than 33 pounds of cheese a year. Packed with calories, loaded with saturated fat and teeming in highly addictive casomorphins, it’s a habit that’s intimately linked to obesity and a litany of chronic illnesses, including heart disease and type-2 diabetes. It’s a habit that wrecks significant havoc on the environment, polluting our skies and poisoning our water table. And it’s a habit that perpetuates unspeakable cruelty on the sentient animals it relies upon to serve its unabating appetite.Nonetheless, the U.S. continues to produce more cheese and dairy products than any other country in the world. Relentless, well-funded dairy industry lobbying efforts have entrenched government subsidies that not only incentivize production but even quietly fund corporate product development and marketing efforts, such as Pizza Hut’s infamous grilled cheese stuffed crust pizza, McDonald’s McCafé products and even Starbucks smoothies — all products specifically produced, developed and marketed to increase consumer dairy consumption courtesy of the federal funded and USDA regulated dairy checkoff program.It’s time to stop the insanity.So let’s talk about it. I can think of no better steward to facilitate a conversation on this subject than my good friend Neal Barnard, M.D.A pre-eminent authority on diet and nutrition and its impact on illnesses such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer’s, Neal is the founder & president of The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), where he leads programs advocating for preventive medicine, good nutrition, and higher ethical standards in research, and the Barnard Medical Center, a ground-breaking non-profit primary care medical practice where board-certified physicians, nurse practitioners, and registered dietitians help patients prevent and reverse serious health problems, leveraging a holistic approach that involves tackling the actual causes of illness, with extra attention on nutrition.Neal is also an adjunct associate professor of medicine at George Washington University and has authored over 70 scientific publications as well as 18 books, including the New York Times best-sellers Power Foods for the Brain*, 21-Day Weight Loss Kickstart*, the USA Today best-seller Dr. Barnard’s Program for Reversing Diabetes* and the subject of today’s conversation, The Cheese Trap: How Breaking a Surprising Addiction Will Help You Lose Weight, Gain Energy, and Get Healthy*.This is a great conversation about all of the aforementioned issues. It’s about how government policy, corporate interests, and regulatory oversight fuel unhealthy consumer food choices. It’s an education on the surprisingly addictive nature of cheese. And it’s a master class on the negative human and planetary health implications of our love affair with dairy and why you need to finally kick the habit.One of my most eye-opening podcasts to date, I urge all of you to listen intently. Take notes if you have to. Listen (or re-listen) to our first conversation (RRP 242). Implement Dr. Barnard’s prodigious wisdom into your daily nutrition regimen. Then take notice as your health begins to flourish, your consciousness expands and your life changes for the better.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Food is the first portal to discovering your best, most authentic self.“ Julie Piatt    “I would totally go vegan but there’s no way I can give up cheese.” If this is you, then today’s episode is required listening.This week my wife and creative partner Julie Piatt returns to the podcast to discuss the hows and whys of ditching dairy in celebration of her brand new book, This Cheese Is Nuts! Delicious Vegan Cheese At Home*, hitting bookstores everywhere Tuesday, June 13.Equal parts mother, author, yogi, musician, and doyenne of vegan cuisine, Julie spent the last two years ensconced in her kitchen lab, dutifully pushing plant-based culinary boundaries to create an extraordinary new work to empower each and all with the required tools and techniques to prepare over 75 facile vegan cheese recipes for home and family.Introducing Cheese 2.0. As her taste-tester in chief, take it from me — it doesn’t mimic dairy cheese.

It’s about why and how you should finally ditch dairy. And it’s about food choice as a powerful political act to improve personal health and sustainably preserve our collective ecological resources for future generations and our animal friends alike.I’m so proud of Julie and I couldn’t be more excited about the impact her new book will no doubt have on positively transforming countless lives in the years to come. The recipes forever changed our lives and I promise they will change yours too. So pick it up for yourself. Pick it up for a loved one. Pick it up for the animals. Pick it up for the planet.

“No matter what you can climb out of any hole. No matter how far in the depths of hell you are. I’ve been down there, but I was willing to climb out of that that and surround myself with positive people. That’s the thing — the association we keep.“John Joseph    Back by popular demand, my good friend, podcast favorite and provacateur-at-large John Joseph returns for an unprecedented 5th appearance on the show to share more of his extraordinary story. A story that lays bare the indelible power of the human spirit to face and transcend unimaginable, seemingly insurmountable obstacles and ultimately transform one’s life wholesale.If you’re a longtime listener, Johnny Bloodclot needs no introduction. For the uninitiated, John is a sui generis American original. The very definition of hardcore. A survivor. A spiritual warrior spouting straight talk directly from the streets of the Lower East Side with one singular, driving purpose:getting people to wake the f&*k up.Conceived and raised in abuse, deprived of opportunity and left to his own devices, John turned to violence and drugs on the rough and tumble streets of New York’s Lower East Side in the 1970’s. It’s a path that predictably led to violence, crime, addiction and incarceration. Spending his teens as a drug mule led to a series of unsavory foster care homes, culminating in unimaginably horrific stints in juvenile detention.Then things went downhill. To avoid long-term incarceration, he enlisted in the Navy, only to go AWOL after a fight. Fleeing the law and rudderless, John found redemption in the hardcore punk rock scene flourishing on Manhattan’s Lower East Side in the early 1980’s. Taken in by the Bad Brains’ frontman H.R., John began to explore not just his musicianship, but his spirituality.  It’s a journey that birthed the Cro-Mags — one of the era’s most iconic and influential hardcore punk bands. Later, he found his spiritual salvation living in a Hare Krishna monastery, birthing a life-long love of meditation, yoga, the vegan lifestyle, racing Ironman triathlons, and most importantly, his profound devotion to service.Renown for his straight talk, no BS approach to living and the power of PMA — positive mental attitude — John continues to tour as frontman for both Cro-Mags and his new band Bloodclot. He also just released a 2nd edition of his memoir Evolution of a Cro-Magnon* and is the author of nutrition primer Meat Is For Pussies*, with a foreword by yours truly.A man who truly walks his talk, every conversation with John leaves me better than before. Today’s conversation proves that just when I think we’ve covered it all, new layers emerge. So even if you’ve enjoyed all of John’s previous appearances on the podcast, this episode will find you riveted by a stream of mind-blowing, never previously told stories that are certain to incite, provoke, educate and inspire.LANGUAGE ADVISORY: John drops more f-bombs in this conversation than I could count. John is John, and editing was out of the question. So if you’re queasy about foul language, consider yourself warned and make sure the kiddos are out of earshot.I love this conversation. But I love John even more. Here’s to my brother from another mother.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

June 4, 2017

“Peak performance equals sustainably getting the most out of yourself and feeling good about it.“Brad Stulberg   Plenty has been written about achieving peak performance in sport, career and life. But there is a black hole in the literature when it comes to the tools and practices required to consistently perform at your absolute best over the course of an athletic season, a long professional career and ultimately an entire lifetime.Until now.This week I convene with Brad Stulberg (@BStulberg) and Steve Magness (@stevemagness), two high performers who both quested for greatness but fell short, succumbing to the paralyzing burnout that all too often destroys the hopes and dreams of even the most talented, determined and capable.Once a rising star at McKinsey & Co. with a stint consulting on health care at The White House, Brad was a golden boy determined to maximize his seemingly unlimited career potential. Instead, he worked himself right out the door of his chosen profession. Reinventing himself as a writer and author, today Brad specializes in the health and the science of human performance, known for his ability to merge the latest science with compelling personal stories to offer readers practical insights that they can apply in their own lives. Currently a columnist for Outside Magazine and New York Magazine, Brad has also written for Forbes, NPR, The Los Angeles Times, Runner’s World, and The Huffington Post. And because Brad’s insights are generally so awesome, they often find their way into my weekly Roll Call newsletter.An elite track & field athlete with very realistic Olympic dreams, Steve clocked an extraordinary 4:01 mile in high school. As a collegiate, he would spend the next several years chasing the elusive sub-4 minute barrier, unable to best what he accomplished as a teen. Steve reinvented himself as one of the most accomplished, respected and in demand track & field and cross country coaches in the world. In addition to serving up duties at the University of Houston, he is the personal coach to some of the most accomplished professional and Olympic runners on the planet.In the wake of their respective course corrections, both Brad and Steve wondered: what could we have done differently? And more importantly, what can be learned from the latest science, our experience and that of others to save people from suffering our fate?The product of that inquiry is Peak Performance: Elevate Your Game, Avoid Burnout and Thrive with the New Science of Success*. Based on science and insight derived from some of the world’s most accomplished athletes, artists, and intellectuals, it’s a must-read primer on the common principles that drive and ultimately sustain performance, regardless if you’re trying to qualify for the Olympics, break ground in mathematical theory, craft an artistic masterpiece or just become a better weekend warrior, parent or professional.Today, I sit down with Brad and Steve to unpack the aforementioned common principles. Chockablock with life-enhancing treasures, this is a great conversation about:My primary takeaway from this exchange? The path to sustained peak performance isn’t a to-do list. It’s a journey of self-becoming. It’s about discovering, uncovering and embracing who you truly are, and constructing a mindful, principled approach to actualizing that identity over the long haul.I absolutely love both of these gentlemen and this takeaway-packed exchange lays bare that heart felt sentiment.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I enjoyed having it.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“My philosophy is that life is all about learning and growing, and that life can be a real adventure of learning, growing, compassion, and joyfulness.”John Mackey   Creating a huge business is one thing. Building it on principles of conscious awareness? Another thing altogether.This week I sit down with John Mackey, the father of conscious capitalism and the unlikely entrepreneur behind a $16 billion grocery behemoth that ushered in a global organic food movement and permanently changed the way we eat, live and think about business.The Bill Gates of organic food, John is the original, current and sole CEO of Whole Foods Markets, which he founded in 1980 and has parented to Fortune 500 status, employing over 90,000 people across 450+ stores in the United States, Canada and the UK.A strong believer in free market principles, Mackey is the co-founder of the Conscious Capitalism Movement and co-authored the New York Times and Wall Street Journal best-seller Conscious Capitalism, which encourages business grounded in principles of ethical consciousness.Consistent with this ethos, John has birthed a myriad of philanthropic efforts, including the Whole Planet Foundation to help end poverty in developing nations, the Local Producer Loan Program to help local food producers expand their businesses, The Global Animal Partnership’s rating scale for humane farm animal treatment, and the Health Starts Here initiative to promote health and wellness.Mackey has been recognized as Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneur of the Year Overall Winner for the United States, Institutional Investor’s Best CEO in America, Barron’s World’s Best CEO, MarketWatch’s CEO of the Year, FORTUNE’s Businessperson of the Year, and Esquire’s Most Inspiring CEO.Aligning his actions with his values, John embraces an extremely grounded lifestyle in stark contrast to his means. This is a guy who in 2006 cut his annual pay to $1, donates all his stock options to charity, walks to work, cooks his own meals and meditates daily.A vegan for many years, John recently released The Whole Foods Diet*. Co-authored by Alona Pulde and Matthew Lederman of Forks Over Knives, it’s a powerful primer that unequivocally establishes a whole foods, plant-based diet as the optimum protocol for health, disease prevention and longevity based on the huge body of science, research, and advice that is available today.This is an amazing conversation about:But most of all, this is a powerful dialog about the incredible power of a plant-based lifestyle to prevent and reverse disease, enhance optimum health and increase longevity — things we all aspire to achieve.I had been wanting to connect with John for years, and our meeting in Austin at Whole Foods HQ didn’t disappoint.

May 25, 2017

“First impressions are actually made non-verbally. It has nothing to do with what you say or don’t say.”Jordan Harbinger    In all honesty, I don’t put that much thought into how I communicate. Jordan Harbinger thinks that’s a mistake. Because the signals all of us routinely emit — verbally, physically and often quite subtly — have a profound impact on how we feel about ourselves, how we are perceived by others, and how we navigate the world.Indeed, the social cues most employ by habit, and without conscious awareness, fundamentally forge our entire human experience, more often than not leading us astray from the relationships, career, goals, and reality we desire.The good news? Social acumen is entirely teachable. To be sure, it’s an inside job. And that job is hard. But by committing to that work and embracing certain scientifically proven practices and strategies, we can indeed dramatically improve our communication skills and thus positively impact our ability to relate to and with others. Over time, the result is enhanced connection, self-esteem, empathy, authenticity and influence, all of which translate into an enhanced quality of life and an expanded sense of personal fulfillment.
Today Jordan joins the podcast to share his experience. A former Wall Street lawyer turned entrepreneur, public speaker and expert in social dynamics, Jordan is the creator and host of the popular Art of Charm podcast. Celebrating its 10th year with over 600 episodes, Art of Charm has been rated one of the top 50 podcast on iTunes and currently receives an amazing 2.5 million downloads per month.Jordan is also the co-founder and owner of a coaching and consulting firm of the same name. Through his Art of Charm bootcamps and training programs, Jordan and his team counsel executives, employees, athletes, soldiers and every day people on the social, psychological, scientific and philosophical skills required to positively transform your career and life.A bit of a disclaimer: despite very much enjoying my experience guesting on Jordan’s show back in 2015, I wasn’t sure Jordan was the best fit for this show. The idea of exploring how to teach charm just didn’t sit all that well with me. It doesn’t feel authentic. But in fairness to Jordan, I think his website, podcast and services are inaccurately named.In truth, Jordan’s message is much more about the human psychology behind what holds us back — and the journey required to overcome the habits that block us from becoming the best versions of who we really are.And that, my friends, is a subject I deem worthy of exploring.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

May 21, 2017

“I was not unhealthy. I was broken.”David Clark   Goals are great. Audacious goals? Even better.But what happens when that quest to touch the outermost edge of your capabilities tips into maddening obsession?David Clark has been there. And this week he returns to the podcast to tell us all about it.Longtime listeners will remember well our first conversation — one of my most popular episodes to date — in which David vividly recalled his extraordinary journey from morbidly obese, full-blown alcoholic into sober, vegan, ultra-running warrior.Not too long ago, David tipped the scales at 320 pounds. Fueled on a steady, death-defying diet of booze, pills and fast food, he was a man hell-bent on wrecking havoc, destruction and woe in the lives of loved ones and anyone unfortunate enough to cross his path,He wasn’t just unhealthy. He was broken.Ultimately Dave met his breaking point. Understanding that if he didn’t change he would surely die, he summoned the will to finally face and overcome his demons, transform his life wholesale and ultimately accomplish feats most sane people would deem impossible.As told in his memoir Out There*, David didn’t just drop 150 pounds on a plant-based diet. He didn’t just complete a half-marathon. He didn’t just complete a marathon. And he didn’t just finish the Badwater 135, but went on to crush an impressive list of ultra-marathons, including a run across the entire United States (along with podcast fave Charlie Engle) and the Quad Boston, in which he ran the Boston marathon course four times without stopping.Along the way, he repaired his broken self, emerging healthy.Mission accomplished. Or so he thought.No matter how far David continued to push the envelope, a void nonetheless remained. A hole in his soul he simply could not fill. So he continued to push, convinced that the answer he sought would surely be found in going further. Farther. Longer. Harder.What had begun as a laudable journey to wholeness had fractured, leading him away from the light — and into darkness.And yet once again, David found his way out.This is a conversation about that journey.It’s about what happens when goals devolve into addictions — an escape from what is most real and important.It’s about the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, and the impact of those stories on our beliefs.And it’s about constant, continual fidelity to growth and re-invention.I sincerely hope you enjoy this powerful, contemplative exchange with the inspiring David Clark.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Pursue what’s in your heart and the universe will conspire to support you.“Rich Roll   Twenty years ago I was a hope to die alcoholic — lost and alone.Despite achieving sobriety, ten years ago I remained lost — overweight, depressed and utterly rudderless.Five years ago this week, I published a book about how I found my way out. A spiritual journey that entailed extreme faith and relentless persistence called Finding Ultra*. Today I celebrate the journey of my rebirth — and pause to honor this five year landmark — by taking a look back.Because the growth I have been blessed to experience isn’t mine to covet.

May 14, 2017

“The body is no match for the power of the mind.“JD Roth   Despite our cultural obsession with weight loss, we’ve never been fatter.Right now, one out of every three U.S. adults are obese. Another third are overweight. Even worse? 18% of our children are morbidly obese with rates continuing to soar. In lockstep with our obesity epidemic is a shocking escalation of chronic lifestyle illness, including high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, and stroke. One out of every three Americans will die of heart disease. Close to 30% of the adult population is diabetic or pre-diabetic. The problem is so bad, 75% of all U.S. healthcare costs are attributable to these conditions — illnesses that quite ironically are avoidable and often reversible through some fairly simple diet and lifestyle changes.So why can’t we lose the weight and keep it off?This is the question JD Roth has devoted his life to answering.The man behind a television empire built on the shoulders of a prime-time juggernaut called The Biggest Loser — which aired for an astonishing 17 seasons — JD is the award-winning producer and reality-TV pioneer behind some of the most successful and prolific television programs of our era. More than a decade ago, JD first introduced viewers to the weight-loss TV arena with The Biggest Loser on NBC – now a worldwide, half-billion-dollar brand – and expanded upon it with Extreme Weight Loss on ABC, which ran for five seasons and airs as Obese in more than 130 countries.JD is also author of Big Fat Truth*, and a brand-new television series of the same name (premiering June 11 at 8pm ET/PT on Z Living), which challenges and guides groups of participants unhappy with their weight and health (including some former Biggest Loser contestants who regained their weight), providing them the tools to uncover and tackle the real issues behind the weight while encouraging them to adopt a whole food, plant-based diet over a three month period of mental, emotional and practical mentorship by JD and a panel of experts that include none other than podcast favorite Michael Greger, MD (and a brief appearance by yours truly).Never before has a show advanced plant-based eating as a central conceit. A first in the history of television, I cannot overstate how excited this is for the movement and the world.Today I sit down with the blockbuster producer to unpack it all — including the whirl of controversy that surrounds the successful shows he created.This is a conversation about the cultural phenomenon of weight loss television that JD originated, framed and fashioned. It’s about the overlooked mental and emotional barriers that prevent too many from achieving and maintaining optimal weight and health. And it’s a conversation about his passion for the plant-based lifestyle, as well as the hows and whys behind his book and new television show that advance this lifestyle as the model way to not only lose weight, but keep it off for good.Irrespective of your opinion on JD’s former shows, I can honestly say that JD is truly passionate about helping people — I’ve seen it first hand, up close and personal. So I urge you to set aside any pre-conceived notions you may harbor and listen with an open mind to what I think you will find is an enjoyable exchange laden with helpful tools and inspiration to inform your journey.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Always go with the choice that scares you the most, because that’s the one that is going to require the most from you.“Turia Pitt  Close your eyes and imagine yourself running a trail ultramarathon in the beautiful Australian outback. You’re enjoying the experience when suddenly you find yourself trapped in a gorge, surrounded by a raging brushfire.The flames quickly close in until you’re surrounded on all sides.No escape.This is how it ends, you think.Then darkness.Against all odds, death is averted. Instead, you lie comatose. Months pass in dormancy. Finally your eyes open, awakening to discover you’re miraculously alive, yet somehow less than whole. A glance at your left hand reveals several fingers missing. On the right? No thumb. And the reason you can’t move? 65% of your body is covered in life threatening burns. Overwhelmed, you allow your eyes once again close, welcoming the comfort of darkness.200 operations follow. Over the next two years, you will die three times during surgery.Miraculously, you somehow survive. Not as a victim, but as a hero.This is the powerful story of Turia Pitt – humanitarian, athlete, and beacon of inspiration and female empowerment to millions across the world.One of Australia’s most admired and widely recognized people, Turia has been profiled everywhere from 60 Minutes to Women’s Weekly. She has scaled the Great Wall of China, competed in the Ironman World Championships and walked the Kokoda Track. A sought-after public speaker, Turia has mentored thousands through her online programs, raised funds and awareness for a variety of philanthropic concerns and authored two books — the recently released Unmasked* (available in the US in audiobook format* only) and Everything To Live For*.This is a conversation about turning tragedy into opportunity. Adversity into advocacy. And experience into service. It’s a conversation about the importance of putting others before yourself and serving those less fortunate.But most of all, this is a powerful conversation about facing life head on — about taking risks, facing your fears and believing in yourself.It was an honor to spend a couple hours with Turia and her fiancé Michael during my recent visit to Sydney. My hope is that our exchange will leave you feeling inspired, empowered and grateful.Or as Turia says, no whinging!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Feeding plants to animals then eating the animals is like filtering water through a sewer then drinking it.”Bruce Friedrich 7.5 billion people currently share this spinning blue planet we call Earth. By 2050, that number will escalate to 9.7 billion. By 2100? 11 billion.How can we possibly feed 11 billion people sustainably?To answer that question we must turn our gaze to the industrialization of animal agriculture. On the surface, what we commonly call factory farming appears incredibly efficient, creating massive economies of scale. But peer just below the surface and you’ll discover a vast operation of mass suffering that is irreparably polluting the environment, eviscerating our dwindling natural resources and destroying human health to boot.Beyond wasteful. Utterly unsustainable. Indefensibly cruel.Ladies and gentlemen, our food system is in dire need of innovation.So let’s talk about it. This week I sit down with Bruce Friedrich, a man who has devoted his life to reforming animal agriculture and innovating the future of food and food systems.Bruce is the executive director of The Good Food Institute and founding partner of New Crop Capital, organizations focused on replacing animal products with plant and culture-based alternatives. He graduated magna cum laude from Georgetown Law and Phi Beta Kappa from Grinnell College, holds additional degrees from Johns Hopkins University and the London School of Economics and was inducted into the United States Animal Rights Hall of Fame in 2004.A popular speaker on college campuses — including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, and MIT — Bruce has appeared on NBC’s Today Show, CNN, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, and Court TV.As compelling as it gets, this is an extraordinary conversation about animal agriculture, planetary health and human well being. It’s about the politics of agriculture and the subsidies, corporations, representatives and lobbyists that support it.But mostly, this is an optimistic forecast of food system innovation — how technology, urgency and popular demand are rapidly converging to create healthy, sustainable and compassionate solutions to help solve our current food, health and environmental crises.Incredibly intelligent, considerate and measured, it was an honor to sit down with Bruce. May our exchange leave you inspired to invest more deeply in where your food comes from and how it impacts the precious world we share.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Diversity is one of the biggest things we need to celebrate – we can learn so much from other people.”Louis Cole Ever wonder what it would be like to get paid to travel the world, jetting from one exotic port of call to the next in search of adventure?Now imagine sharing these experiences with millions of people all over the world on the daily.Few could pull this off. But if you feel the allure, then you’re in for a treat with this week’s guest — because Louis Cole is the master.With almost 2 million subscribers on his Fun For Louis YouTube channel (plus 1.5 million on Instagram), this British-born dreadlocked globetrotter was one of the first (if not the very first) daily travel vloggers to break out — an internet personality so sensational, YouTube crown prince Casey Neistat (RRP 73, 144 & 174) dubbed Louis the godfather of daily vlogging.Louis has crossed India on a rickshaw and skydived high above Dubai. He has skateboarded along Sydney Harbor and sailed a hot air balloon in Kenya. From kayaking in New Zealand to salsa dancing in Cuba, it’s just another day of fun for Louis — a guy committed to sucking the marrow out of life.But the true allure of Louis isn’t travel. And it isn’t vlogging.No, Louis’ greatest talent is his ability to inspire wonder. Imbued with a rare enthusiasm for embracing all that life delivers, he has an infectious touch when it comes to encouraging his followers to pursue big dreams while he enjoys his own.After a brief training progress report with my coach Chris Hauth, this week I sit down with Louis to find out exactly how he created such an extraordinary life.This is a conversation about cultivating imagination, then translating that imagination into reality. It’s about the mindset, tools and practices required to craft the trajectory of your wildest dreams. And to embrace the life you deserve.An old soul with a big heart, Louis is a truly beautiful guy. I sincerely hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I enjoyed having it.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

April 16, 2017

“Simplicity boils down to two steps: Identify the essential. Eliminate the rest.”Leo Babauta As longtime listeners know well, minimalism, mindfulness & sustainable living are favorite recurring themes of this show. Guests like Andrew Morgan and Joshua Katcher have elucidated our our cultural addiction to fast fashion. Andy Puddicombe, Jason Garner, Light Watkins, Dan Harris, Charlie Knoles, Guru Singh, WuDe and others have espoused the benefits of meditation. And people like Joshua Fields Milburn have shared the strategies and value of learning to live better with less.Perhaps you even watched Joshua and Ryan Nicodemus’ documentary, Minimalism*. If you did, you may recall seeing Leo Babauta featured. A husband and father of six, Leo is the creator of Zen Habits, one of the largest single-author blogs in the world with a fanatic global fanbase in the millions. Named one of TIME magazine’s Top 10 blogs, Leo was indisputably one of the first prominent voices on the internet advocating the power and beauty of embracing simplicity and mindfulness to transcend the chaos of our daily existence. Through his writing, he has taught millions how to clear mental, emotional, financial and physical clutter so we can focus on what’s most important, create something amazing, and find contentment, purpose and meaning in our lives. Count me a fan.Today finds Leo with a new goal: to end human struggle.Audacious? Sure. Naively optimistic? Maybe. But Leo is no ordinary human. Uniquely extraordinary, he might just have what it tales to help birth a new age of consciousness.Despite the fact that we had never met in person prior to this podcast, I can’t overstate the extent to which Leo’s work positively influenced my personal transformation and continues to this day to inspire my path. An authentic example of the powerful ideals he espouses, it was a personal thrill to finally meet him.More importantly, our exchange exceeded all expectations.This is a conversation about how to create healthy, personal boundaries. It’s about the distinction between greed and ambition. It’s about combating our consumerist programming through meditation, yoga, and mindfulness practices. And it’s a conversation about his vegan lifestyle and why he unschools his children.But overall, this is a potent conversation about the path to self-mastery. It’s about how to let go of negative habits and adopt positive practices with staying power in service to your highest, most authentic self.Because if you ask Leo, life is for living, not for productivity.Present, gracious and wise beyond measure, Leo is a rare voice worth heeding. And this is a podcast you’re going to want to listen to more than once.I sincerely hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I enjoyed having it.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

April 9, 2017

“Being your true self is the most effective formula for success there is.“Danielle LaPorteFrom fire walks to ice baths and juice cleanses to intermittent fasting, silent retreats, talk therapy and everything in between, the world of personal development is limitless. And that’s not counting all the podcasts, audiobooks, online courses, weekend seminars, weeklong symposiums, webinar tutorials and mastermind intensives that can occupy a well-intentioned seeker dawn to dusk for the next 10,000 years.Beyond the overwhelm, the self-help universe is fraught with snake oil slinging charlatans obfuscating truth from fiction — and all too often salvation from predation.Efforts to divine truth from bullshit render imperfect results. Anxiety ensues. To cope, we double down on improving upon our self-improvement until we wake up one day and realize what began as a laudable quest for growth has suddenly become an obsessive malignancy — a sort of spiritual eating disorder gnawing away on our very soul.Danielle LaPorte has been there. And she’s got a message for you:You’re the answer to your question.Named to Oprah’s inaugural SuperSoul 100, Entrepreneur magazine calls Danielle equal parts poet and entrepreneurial badass. I call her a powerful force of nature — a teacher, a leader and a mom who also happens to be a lauded public speaker, multiple bestselling author and doyenne of blogging for millions at DanielleLaPorte.com, which Forbes calls the best place online for kickass spirituality.Honest, accessible and authentic to the core, Danielle’s books include The Fire Starter Sessions: A Soulful + Practical Guide to Creating Success on Your Own Terms* and The Desire Map: A Guide to Creating Goals with Soul*. Her newest book, which hits shelves everywhere May 16 and is available for pre-order now, is entitled White Hot Truth: Clarity for Keeping It Real on Your Spiritual Path from One Seeker to Another*. A high recommend, it’s a fun and accessible rollercoaster ride through the machinations of personal growth, the pitfalls of spiritual glamour and the self-criticism that too often accompanies self-help to deliver a powerful edict: you are your own guru.A beacon of compassion, Danielle is an extraordinary human. A woman devoted to helping people transcend their limitations, access their potential, and truly self-actualize. It was an honor to finally sit down with her and talk it all out.This is a fun, deep and deeply fun dive into Danielle’s divine path. It’s an exploration of self-help adventures gone wrong and the breakthroughs that make it all worth it. It’s about what happens when spirituality becomes a to do list. And why sometimes we have to fall for lies in order to discover  our truth.Ultimately, it’s not how you seek spiritual growth, it’s why you seek it. Answer this, and you are on the path to becoming your own guru.I sincerely hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I enjoyed having it.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“If parents back off the pressure and anxiety over grades and achievement and focus on the bigger picture—a love of learning and independent inquiry—grades will improve and test scores will go up.“Jessica LaheyWe all want what’s best for our kids.So we roll up our sleeves and insert ourselves in their education, pitching in on homework and managing school projects. We stimulate them with an endless revolving door of activities. We do what we can to foster good grades, college application-worthy experiences and self-esteem. Along the way, we celebrate victories as if they were our own. And swoop in to protect when things go south.The instinct is laudable: set up our children for success, by any means necessary.But what if we have it all wrong? What if all this hyper-competitive, overly-protective micro-management is doing more harm than good?As a parent of young girls, I desperately want to do everything I can to serve their long-term interests. To learn more, I sat down with educator, writer and speaker Jessica Lahey (@jesslahey). A graduate of the University of Massachusetts with a J.D. concentrating on juvenile and education law from the University of North Carolina School of Law, Jessica is an an English and writing teacher, correspondent for the Atlantic, commentator for Vermont Public Radio, and writes the “Parent-Teacher Conference” column for the New York Times.She is also the author of the New York Times bestselling book, The Gift of Failure: How the Best Parents Learn to Let Go So Their Children Can Succeed* (highly recommend for parents) and if that’s not enough, she also explores writing and creativity on #AmWriting, a podcast she co-hosts with KJ Dell’Antonia, a columnist and contributing editor for the New York Times’ Well Family.Specific topics discussed include:If you are a parent, this episode is a must listen. If you don’t have kids, you will nonetheless find Jessica’s powerful insights on the psychology of motivation and the mechanisms that promote learning absolutely invaluable and applicable to each and every one of us.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

March 26, 2017

“True self discovery begins where your comfort zone ends.”Adam BraunIt’s no secret that aspects of our current education system are at best antiquated, at worst broken. Whether it’s quality education in the developing world, properly training people to meet our rapidly changing workforce needs or the crippling student loan debt that onerously burdens millions of young people, we’re long overdue for some systemic upgrades.This week’s guest has devoted his life to tackling these problems.A young man with a bright future, Adam Braun graduated from Brown and threw himself headfirst into a burgeoning career in finance when an extended backpacking trip across the developing world forever changed his perspective. Inspired by a sense of purpose and a call to service, in 2008 Adam walked away from Wall Street to launch Pencils of Promise – a for purpose philanthropic endeavor with the mission of building schools in countries across the world. A massive success, Pencils of Promise is responsible for over 400 new schools to date, distinguishing itself as one of a handful of charitable organizations that has fundamentally changed how we think about and practice philanthropy and giving.Named to Forbes’ 30 Under 30 List, Business Insider’s 40 Under 40 List, and Wired’s Smart List of 50 People Changing the World, Adam chronicles his remarkable journey in The Promise of a Pencil*, a powerful story of awakening and action that demonstrates how one person can make a huge difference in a short period of time. Debuting at #2 on the New York Times Bestseller list and going on to becoming a #1 national bestseller, it’s a favored read among business leaders and can even be found on many a college syllabus.Today finds Adam embarking a new chapter, taking on higher education with an ambitious new start up called MissionU – a for-profit for purpose, venture-backed organization that presents a compelling alternative to traditional college by sending students into the workforce debt-free.This is a great conversation about Adam’s journey to entrepreneurial success. It’s about the current state of education, the business of education, and the innovative path forward. It’s a conversation about self-awareness, integrity and lightning moments. But mostly, this is a conversation about the transformative power of leading a meaningful life of service fueled by purpose.I applaud Adam’s commitment to dream big and solve huge problems. A special human, I promise you will be captivated by the extraordinary story behind it all.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

March 19, 2017

“You can never really dream too big. Just open up your mind and if you really do want it bad enough, you can achieve it through hard work.”Conor DwyerI know what you’re thinking. It’s rather convenient for any Olympic athlete to say that hard work trumps talent.For perspective, take a glance at the palmarès of this week’s guest:In total, Conor Dwyer has won seventeen medals in major international swimming competitions: nine gold, six silver, and two bronze. I could geek out on his statistics forever but you get the picture. The dude is super fast in the pool; one of the fastest swimmers of all time.An extraordinary athlete, Conor is obviously immensely talented. So this idea that hard work beats talent can’t possibly apply to him, right?Not so fast. Conor was the furthest thing from a natural talent right out of the gate. His performances out of high school were so mediocre in fact, he couldn’t even get the attention of college coaches let alone a swimming scholarship. I simply cannot overstate how rare it is in competitive swimming that an athlete of his current caliber had yet to distinguish himself by 18. It just doesn’t happen.But Conor refused to give up. Through persistence and a robust work ethic relentlessly applied, a series of circumstances slowly aligned. A believing coach appeared to mentor him, followed by training partners to push him to new levels of possibility and further fuel his self-belief in potential. Over time, all the important ingredients alchemized to bake the cake that is the superstar athlete we know today as Conor Dwyer.This week Conor shares his extraordinary story from bench warmer to Olympic champion. A story that lays bare a simple core truth I have experienced myself:when the heart is pure and fueled by self-belief, extreme faith, unwavering patience and an unabating work ethic, the universe conspires to support the dream.One of the good guys, Conor lives it with every breath. A recipe for success that has fueled his accomplishments and will support anyone — irrespective of talent level — in the pursuit of an audacious dream.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

March 12, 2017

“There are two kinds of cardiologists: vegans and those who haven’t read the data.”Dr. Kim Williams, MD President, American College of CardiologyImagine four commercial airliners crashing every single hour of every single day of every single year.It’s unfathomable. And yet that is how many Americans die from heart disease annually. In fact, an unbelievable 1 out of every 3 people in the U.S. will perish from this one disease.Meanwhile, 70% of Americans are obese or overweight. In the coming decade, 50% of Americans will be diagnosed diabetic or pre-diabetic. An economic disaster, 75% of all health care costs in America are attributable to these and a few other chronic lifestyle illnesses.It’s devastating. And yet the most heartbreaking aspect of this crisis is that 80-90% of these illnesses are very easily preventable  and often entirely reversible via some rather simple diet and lifestyle alternations.It’s the food, stupid.This week I’m joined by Kip Andersen and Keegan Kuhn, the filmmaking dynamic duo behind the groundbreaking documentary Cowspiracy, to talk about their brand new follow up. Equally groundbreaking, What The Health explores the relationship between our food systems and big business, exposing the collusion and corruption that is making us sick, keeping us sick and costing us trillions in healthcare dollars.Whereas Cowspiracy explores the impact of animal agriculture on environmental health, What The Health focuses on human health. Perhaps the most important documentary you will ever see, it’s a film about the power of special interest groups to drive unhealthy consumer spending habits. It’s about environmental racism and the impact of animal agriculture on community health. And it’s about why you need to rethink for yourself everything you’ve ever been told about the relationship between business and food, the impact of food choice on personal health, and your body’s incredible, innate power to prevent, fight and even reverse the chronic lifestyle illnesses that are unnecessarily killing people by the millions.Starting March 16, the film will be available to watch worldwide at whatthehealthfilm.com – where you can also pre-order the DVD and cookbook as well as set up a screening in your town (I’m hosting one on March 29). In addition, for the first four days of the film’s release (between March 16 – 20), Keegan and Kip will be donating half of all proceeds to Food Not Bombs – an amazing, for-purpose organization that feeds thousands of people free vegan meals across North America and the world.Kip and Keegan are truly breaking paradigms. Making the world a better place. And changing lives with what I think is the most important film of the year. A film that just might save your life or that of a loved one. I aspire to their level of courage and advocacy. And I sincerely hope you enjoy this exchange.On a final note, I’m hosting a private screening of What The Health on March 29 in Thousand Oaks, CA. Only a few tickets remain. To grab one, visit: whatthehealthfilm.eventbrite.com.

“Pay attention to your voice. Be yourself. Be colorful. Be weird.”Brogan GrahamThere are leaders and then there are followers. The best leaders engender devotion to a big, new idea. But only a few successfully grow their conceit into a thriving a enterprise that withstands the test of time. Fewer still scale to mainstream cultural impact.Then there are the charmed select who simply see the world differently. Not how it is, but how it could be. How it should be. The rare figure who infuses his or her vision with a contagion of enthusiasm and connectivity so infectious and powerful, it ignites a revolution – catalyzing a movement that penetrates the mainstream, hypnotizes the masses and forever alters the perspective and behavior of all who fall under its spell.This is the story of Brogan Graham — an irreverent, way-outside-the-box fitness fanatic who, along with partner-in-crime Bojan Mandaric decided to flip the fitness industry on its head and make the world a better place with a creation dubbed November Project. No gyms or machines. No fees or dues. Just two dudes, wide open public space and a fervent, gung-ho tribe of thousands taking over not just urban landscapes but the world, one city at a time.If you’re into fitness and live in a metropolis, chances are you’ve already caught wind of NP. Maybe you’ve even attended one of their infamous morning workouts.But for those unfamiliar, November Project started as a simple month-long workout pact between Brogan and Bojan, two former rowers who wanted to stay fit through the cold New England months. One by one, a burgeoning community of fitness freaks joined the party. And before long, the few morphed into a fanatical multitude, bonding around NP’s free, open-to-anyone, frentic sweat revivals – the more ice, sleet, snow, and rain the better.Dubbed “the ‘Fight Club’ of running clubs”, November Project has matured into a flashmob fitness revolution that now dominates the pre-dawn urban landscape of cities all across North America, Europe, the United Kingdom and even parts of Asia. Thoroughly grassroots and populist to the core, it’s a category-defying movement that is redefining how we think about and practice fitness by leveraging community, a simple sense of accountability and open public spaces to motivate and encourage people of all ages, shapes, sizes and levels — welcoming everyone from Olympic medalists and professional athletes all the way to complete fitness rookies and recent couch potatoes.The idea: use movement to turn strangers into friends and connect everyone to the city in which they live.The goal: world domination.This week I sit down Brogan — one-half of the beautiful high-energy, charismatic superhero duo that birthed it all — to find out how he did it, and why.I was super stoked to meet up with Brogan. From the minute he pulled into my driveway and gave me a bear hug (he’s a big dude), I knew it was a bromance in the making. I have a strong feeling this is but the first of many future collaborations.This is an amazing conversation about the power of community and storytelling to drive positive cultural change. It’s about the audacity to dream big, think different, and act outside the box. It’s about the freedom and power of being you. And it’s a conversation about unlocking untapped reservoirs of human potential to step into your best, most fully actualized self.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“I love the feeling of anticipation that comes from having a huge, scary event on the horizon; in fact, that’s when I have a sense of living life to the fullest.”Kimberley ChambersClose your eyes and imagine yourself 30 miles off the coast of San Francisco, swimming in the freezing cold, shark-infested waters famously dubbed the Red Triangle. No wetsuit. In the middle of the night.Most would call this lunacy.Kimberley Chambers calls this home.This week’s guest is one of the most accomplished record-setting marathon open water swimmers in the world. Her story is incredibly inspiring, but not for the reasons you might imagine. Her story is inspiring because just nine years ago, Kim was not a swimmer at all, suffering a life-threatening accident that nearly claimed her leg and her overall enthusiasm for life.The morning started out like every other morning. The New Zealand born former ballerina and rower turned software executive left her San Francisco apartment and accidentally tripped, toppling down a treacherous flight of stairs.We saved your leg. But it’s unlikely you will walk again.The doctor’s verdict presented Kim with a choice: accept permanent disability. Or prove them wrong.Needless to say, she chose the latter.After countless surgeries and an excruciatingly prolonged rehabilitation, a friend encouraged her to try swimming. Although foreign to the water, she immediately took to it. A ticket to freedom. But the real turning point came the moment she first jumped into the frigid San Francisco Bay. In an instant, she had found sanctuary. To this day, it’s a love affair with cold water and the tight-knit community of like-minded souls who embrace it that changed everything about her life and how she lives it.An inner fire ignited, Kim began to channel her newfound passion into a series of death-defying, envelope-pushing open-water marathon challenges that have redefined the limits of human potential and transformed her into the elite athlete she is today.Among Kim’s many accomplishments:This is a conversation about the boundaries of human potential. It’s about the capacity to turn tremendous adversity into boundless opportunity. It’s about finding joy and adventure outside the comfort zone. It’s a conversation about reframing identity to step into and own — really own — our most authentic, fully actualized selves.And I suppose it’s about how to not get eaten by a shark.Delightfully engaging, ever humble, and beautifully human, Kim embodies everything you seek in a modern day female super hero.It was a pleasure to spend time with her and it is my hope that our conversation will leave you deeply reconsidering the limits of your own potential.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“No dark fate determines the future – we do. Each day and each moment, we are able to create and recreate our lives and the very quality of human life on our planet.”His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond TutuNobel Peace Prize Laureates His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu have both survived more than fifty years of exile. Both have endured the soul-crushing violence of oppression. And yet despite their hardships—or, as they would say, because of them—they are two of the most joyful people on the planet.How is this possible? And what can we learn from their example to cultivate more joy in the face of life’s inevitable suffering?
To answer this question, in 2015 Douglas Abrams united the two spiritual giants in Dharamsala, India on the occasion of the Dalai Lama’s 80th birthday. During the course of what became a rare, five-day conversation on the nature of human happiness and suffering, the two Nobel Peace Prize recipients traded intimate stories, teased each other continually, and shared their spiritual practices. By the end of a week filled with laughter and punctuated with tears, these two global heroes had stared into the abyss and despair of our time and revealed how to live a life brimming with joy.A beautiful synthesis of this transcendent union, it’s no surprise that Abrams’ The Book of Joy* became an instant New York Times bestseller. It’s a book that deeply humanizes an Archbishop who has never claimed sainthood and a Dalai Lama who considers himself a simple monk. It’s a book that transports you deep within the intimate friendship that binds these two incredible souls. And it’s a book that vividly probes the very nature of joy itself — the illusions that eclipse it, the obstacles that obscure it, the practices that cultivate it, and the pillars that sustain it.In addition to being a celebrated author, editor and literary agent, Doug is the founder and president of the creative book and media agency Idea Architects, where he works with true visionaries to create a wiser, healthier, and more just world. He is also the co-founder with Pam Omidyar and Bishop Desmond Tutu of HumanJourney.com, a public benefit company working to share life-changing and world-changing ideas. Doug has worked with Desmond Tutu as his co-writer and editor for over a decade, and before founding his own literary agency, he was a senior editor at HarperCollins and also served for nine years as the religion editor at the University of California Press.I wanted to know more about what my Stanford classmate learned spending so much intimate time with two of the planet’s most conscious and revered spiritual leaders. What was his biggest takeaway? How did he synthesize their wisdom into such an extraordinary book? And what impact has the experience had on how he lives his life today?This conversation is the result. It’s everything I was hoping for, and then some.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“The only bad race is one you don’t learn something from.”Mark AllenBetween 1982 and 1988, Mark Allen launched six attempts to claim the title of Ironman World Champion.Each year he was squarely defeated by his arch rival, the legendary Dave Scott.In 1989, the two titans of triathlon once again descended upon the white hot lava fields of Hawaii to reprise their annual duel in a spectacular showdown that would make history as the greatest race Ironman had ever seen. Dubbed The Iron War, Allen & Scott raced neck and neck at blistering speeds for 8 hours and would cross the finish line less than one minute apart — decimating the previous world record and redefining the limits of human endurance in the process.When the dust settled, Mark Allen finally emerged victorious. And over the next several years the man they call The Grip would become arguably the most successful triathlete in the sport’s history with six Hawaii Ironman World Championship titles, 10 Nice International Triathlon titles and countless other victories across distances, terrains and fields of every variety.So how did Mark Allen go from perennial also-ran to an athlete ESPN dubbed “The Greatest Endurance Athlete of All Time”? The answer might surprise you. Because it has nothing to do with fitness, nutrition or gear.Instead, it has everything to do with spirituality.Without a doubt, Mark’s embrace of shamanism unlocked hidden reservoirs of human potential. It’s a devotion that broke the glass ceiling on his mindset and plateaued career and ultimately propelled him to staggering heights of athletic success.But how? And what does it all means to him now?I needed to know. So I jumped in my truck, drove to his house Santa Cruz and put a microphone in front of him.This conversation is the result. It’s a conversation about Mark’s remarkable life and his ongoing quest for expansion. It’s about the importance of aligning yourself with nature’s rhythms. It’s about investing in yourself, cultivating self-understanding and honing a positive mindset. And it’s about the crucial role humility — detaching from ego — plays in manifesting personal potential.Bottom line? If you really want to soar, look within. Deep within.It was an absolute honor to speak with Mark.

“We, ourselves, are an ecosystem and we’re intimately connected to the earth that we live on and everything that we do to it.”Rachel Carlton AbramsWe are all innately gifted with something called body intelligence — an intuitive sense of what best serves our mental, physical and emotional well-being.However, most of us disconnect from our bodies’ persistent efforts to communicate, muting it out to favor the breakneck pace of our modern lives. Left unchecked, this leaves us at serious risk of what this week’s guest calls chronic body depletion – a crisis of mind, body and spirit that can lead to everything from weight gain and chronic pain to high blood pressure, heart disease, depression, autoimmune disease and more.This week Rachel Carlton Abrams, MD, MHS, ABIHM joins the podcast to help us better cultivate our body intelligence, so that we can begin to properly treat the cause of what ails us and set a better trajectory for optimum healing and lifelong health.Dr. Abrams is a board-certified primary care, family practice physician, integrative health expert and author with over two decades of experience in preventive and comprehensive care medicine. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford University, received her medical degree from UC San Francisco, earned her master’s degree in Holistic Health and Medical Sciences from UC Berkeley, and has been voted the “Best Doctor” in Santa Cruz County every year from 2010 to 2016.In the scope of her dynamic practice, she works with many of the world’s most influential people, from CEOs to billionaire entrepreneurs to Nobel Peace laureates, and has spent countless hours addressing everyday patients with chronic health conditions.The author of several books on holistic health, relationships and sexuality, her latest offering, BodyWise: Discovering Your Body’s Intelligence for Lifelong Health and Healing*, skillfully and accessibly guides the reader on a journey of discovery towards creating the vibrant, balanced, healthy life you have always deserved.This is a fun and super informative conversation packed with knowledge nuggets and practical wisdom takeaways all designed to cultivate your own body intelligence. An intelligence that will help you take better responsibility for yourself, your environment, your behaviors, your relationships, and your health so that you can fuel your body’s natural predisposition to heal and thrive.Specific topics covered include:It was an absolute joy talking to Dr. Abrams and I’m delighted to bring you our conversation.

“The mission is to educate people and I think the more we allow people to educate themselves  the more they feel empowered to make lifestyle choices that work for them.”Marco BorgesThis is a special mid-week episode of the podcast featuring a panel discussion that took place at the Miami Seed Food and Wine Festival in November 2016 between me and Marco Borges, the CEO of 22 Days Nutrition – a plant-based nutrition products and meal delivery service he founded in partnership with Jay-Z and Beyonce.If you are new to the podcast, I implore you to check out my first conversation with Marco, RRP #195 — it’s great.Since that day Marco and I have become very close.

“Staying consistent over a long period of time is ultimately the greatest way to prove success.”Casey WassermanA force in business, civic affairs, politics, and philanthropy in Los Angeles and beyond, Casey Wasserman is perhaps best known as the chairman and CEO of Wasserman — one of the world’s largest, most powerful, and most successful sports, entertainment and lifestyle marketing and management agencies, representing brands, properties and talent on a global basis.When he’s not negotiating on behalf of Nike, ESPN, Andrew Luck or Russell Westbrook, he’s either leading the charge to bring the 2024 Summer Olympic Games to Los Angeles as Chairman of LA 2024, or funding education, health, arts & human rights initiatives via his  Wasserman Foundation philanthropic arm.Lovingly and painstakingly mentored throughout his childhood by his late grandfather Lew Wasserman — one of the most legendary Hollywood talent agents and studio executives of all time — Casey’s love of business, sports and entrepreneurship was born early. By ten, he was a torch bearer during the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. By twelve, he was officially employed in professional sports as a ballboy for the Cleveland Browns. And by 24 he would not only own his first professional sports organization — the Los Angeles Avengers Arena League football team — he was named Chairman of the entire league.I’ve known Casey very casually for a couple years. What impresses me most isn’t the success and accolades. Instead, it’s how he consistently comports himself — with grounded self-awareness, honest humility, and a very present sense of what is most important in life.This is a great exchange about Casey’s remarkable life. It’s a conversation about business, entrepreneurship and risk. It’s about the indelible power of mentorship. It’s about creating a legacy. But most of all, it’s a conversation about that which is required to pursue a life of purpose and meaning.I have tremendous respect for this amazing man.

January 22, 2017

“Dreams don’t work unless you do.”Travis BarkerDubbed one of the “100 Greatest Drummers of All Time” by Rolling Stone, Travis Barker rose from blue collar roots to become one of the world’s most talented, prolific and hard working rock stars — a multi-hyphenate musician-producer-entrepreneur who initially made his mark as the drummer for Blink-182, the influential, multi-platinum punk-rock band that earned it’s very first Grammy nomination this week for it’s latest release, California.Today, Travis is celebrated for his unique percussive acumen; a rare ability to collaborate with a diversity of musical giants — people like Eminem, Lil Wayne, Slash, Mary J. Blige, RZA, Tom Morello and Steve Aoki — across a swath of genres that reach past rock to country, jazz, hip hop and everything in between.Extending his entrepreneurial flair beyond music, Travis is also the founder of accessory/apparel company Famous Stars and Straps as well as LaSalle Records and is an investor in a variety of ventures including Crossroads Kitchen – one of Los Angeles’ best restaurants and perhaps the most acclaimed vegan restaurant in the world.Travis bares his soul in Can I Say: Living Large, Cheating Death, and Drums, Drums, Drums* — a deeply personal and brutally honest memoir chronicling the highlights and lowlights of the renowned drummer’s art and life, including the harrowing plane crash that nearly killed him and his traumatic road to recovery. Ultimately, it’s a book about personal survival. Constant reinvention. Musical salvation. And fatherhood.Travis Barker is a great rock star. But behind the tattoos, sold out arenas and dope rides lives a quiet, soulful artist with a prodigious work ethic. A sober consciousness birthed from pain. Etched from hardship, Travis Barker has survived some serious shit. But it’s our wounds that make us human. And it’s that humanity that interests me the most.This is a conversation about a remarkable life. The pivotal moments that forged it. The premonitions that foretold it. The intuitions that directed it. The humanity behind it. And the heart that animates it.Open, humble and present, I absolutely loved spending time with Travis. I sincerely hope you enjoy the first of what I hope will be many future exchanges.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

January 16, 2017

“I just want people to be consuming nutrient dense plants so they don’t have to drag around this chemistry set of a body & suffer.”Darin OlienWhat’s it like to traipse the far outreaches of the globe in search of the the world’s greatest edible food sources for optimal health?Meet the Indiana Jones of Superfoods.One of the most popular guests of 2015, this week my friend Darin Olien (@superlifeliving) returns to the podcast to delve deep on the next level nutrition insights he’s gleaned from his extraordinary adventure-based experiences as a widely recognized exotic superfoods hunter, wellness advocate, supplement formulator & environmental activist.Over the last twenty plus years, Darin has explored every imaginable port of call across the developing world questing for better, more natural pathways to ultimate wellness. Communing with thousands of rural farmers, growers and manufacturers in remote communities across Peru, Bhutan, the Amazon, the Himalayas, the South Pacific, Latin America and Asia, Darin now shepherds exotic, high-quality, fair-trade superfoods and indigenous herbal commodities to market.Perhaps best known for his work with fitness company Beachbody, Darin was instrumental in the development and ongoing formulation of the wildly successful whole-food supplement, Shakeology. He chronicles his experience and expertise in Superlife: The 5 Simple Fixes That Will Make You Healthy, Fit & Eternally Awesome* (just released in paperback), as well as on his website Superlife.com, where he demystifies health, fitness, nutrition, and longevity into simple daily actions designed to promote life-long wellness.Plant-based, ripped, and bearing more than a passing resemblance to his workout buddy Laird Hamilton, what is most intriguing to me about Darin isn’t just that he is a respected authority on the healing potential of food. And it isn’t just that he has been instrumental in introducing these so called superfoods to western consumers. What is most interesting is his commitment to do it right. A deep rooted responsibility to fairly, sustainably and transparently support the long-term interests of indigenous grower communities against the industrialized threat posed by the well-funded, politically powerful agricultural interests responsible for decimating the planet’s precious rainforests at an unfathomable rate.An inspiration to me personally, this is a guy who walks his talk. From the foods he consumes to the lifestyle habits he practices, Darin is the thriving embodiment of what it means to truly own and take responsibility for your health, your life and the planet we collectively enjoy.But what exactly is a superfood? Are these foods truly “super” or is it all just exaggerated marketing hype?Our first conversation tracked Darin’s life story. Packed with takeaways, today’s exchange deep dives into the efficacy of exotic fruits, herbs, adaptogens and mushrooms. Parsing fact from hyperbole, it’s a conversation about the most important superfoods you should be incorporating into your daily routine and why. It’s a mind-blowing discourse on the importance of water quality and next-level hydration. It’s an exploration of Darin’s pre-workout routine and nutrition essentials. And it’s about our collective responsibility to support ecological rainforest preservation and the indigenous communities that protect them.But ultimately, this is a conversation about big picture fundamentals – how to adopt long-term nutrition and lifestyle habits with staying power that will positively impact your performance, extend your longevity, improve your overall wellness, and preserve our planet’s beautiful bounty.Specific topics covered include:I absolutely love this guy. I love this conversation. And I think you will too.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

January 9, 2017

“Yoga is not an Olympic contest—we’re not here to prove what we can do, we’re here to improve what we can’t do.”Guru SinghInspiration. We crave it. We need it. We love it.But inspiration alone is a salve that does not cure. Because it rarely translates into positive lifestyle adaptations sustained over time.For that you need something called purpose.Purpose derives from a keen awareness of self. An awareness that cannot be found in externalities but instead emanates from the deep recesses of your soul — a place far removed from the dopamine-inducing inspiration hits we restlessly seek outside ourselves.Indeed, purpose is an inside job. So this week, we turn inward. A conversation designed to cultivate that awareness, amplify intuition, and enliven the soul so that we can more deeply connect with our unique purpose and awaken to our highest, most authentic selves.I can think of no better steward to ignite this process than master spiritual teacher and celebrated Kundalini yoga wizard Guru Singh (@gurusinghyogi).Imagine a modern-day rock star Gandalf dropping mad guitar licks between pearls of timeless wisdom that beautifully fuse of Eastern mysticism with Western pragmatism and you start to get the picture.Named “Best Guru in LA” by Los Angeles magazine, for the last 40 years Guru Singh has been studying and teaching Kundalini Yoga – a 5,000 year old ancient science and school of yoga focused on awakening the primal energy known as shakti for the purpose of spiritual enlightenment. He is the author of several books (enumerated below) and a powerful lecturer uplifting thousands worldwide. An extraordinary teacher, he also serves as a behind-the-scenes guide to many a luminary, including Fortune 500 CEOs, athletes, artists and even Tony Robbins.A peer of rock legends like Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and the Grateful Dead, Guru Singh is also a supremely talented musician who began his recording career on Warner Bros’ Sire label in the 1960s. When he isn’t recording tracks with people like Seal, he’s bringing down the house on the daily at Yoga West, his Los Angeles home base.Simply put, Guru Singh is one of the coolest people I have ever met — a huge, beautiful consciousness I’m proud to call friend.It’s an honor to share his story and wisdom with you today.My hope is that that this conversation will catalyze your desire to peer more deeply inward. That it will spark a yearning to more thoroughly cultivate your latent intuition. And ultimately that it helps set a trajectory for your journey towards the ultimate superpower — unlimited awareness.To rise up, you gotta lay down. It is there that you will find purpose.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

“When you think you’re done, you’re only at 40% of your total potential.”David GogginsThis week’s guest is incontrovertibly the most inspirational person I have ever met — a man that will catapult you into 2017 with the inspiration and tools to chase huge dreams, shatter limits, and actualize your best, most authentic self.Often referred to as the toughest athlete on the planet, David Goggins (@davidgoggins) is the only member of the US Armed Forces to complete SEAL training (including THREE Hell Weeks), the U.S. Army Ranger School (where he graduated as Enlisted Honor Man) and Air Force tactical air controller training.But David is perhaps best known for his superhuman feats of strength and ultra-endurance.After several of his friends died in a 2005 helicopter crash while deployed in Afghanistan, David honored their memory by tackling the 10 most difficult endurance challenges on Earth to raise funds and awareness for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, which provides college scholarships and grants to the children of fallen special ops soldiers.Hence began a most unexpected yet remarkably storied athletic career as one of the world’s most accomplished endurance athletes. Highlights include:But perhaps David’s greatest accomplishment is that throughout his life, he has faced and overcome a concatenation of seemingly insurmountable obstacles to become the man he is today – obstacles like asthma, sickle cell anemia, psychological and physical abuse, obesity, academic struggles, and even a congenital heart defect that often left him competing — and winning — on a mere fraction of his actual physical capabilities.In addition to being one of the most remarkable people I have ever met, David has had a profound impact on me personally. It was his singular example that ignited my passion for ultra-endurance and fueled the self-belief required to pursue a new life. In truth, I’m not sure I would have achieved my athletic and life goals had he not blazed the path before me. I simply cannot ever repay the debt of gratitude I have for this man.One of the most powerful podcasts I have ever produced, this a conversation about the primacy of purpose to cultivate your inner voice. It’s about passion and self-accountability. It’s about the limiting beliefs that hold us back and the importance of mindset to overcome them. And it’s about the embrace of suffering as a crucible for growth and self-knowledge.But ultimately, this is a conversation about what it means to be truly alive.Welcome to 2017 people. It’s time to check your excuses at the door. It’s time to stop talking yourselves out of being great. It’s time to get comfortable being uncomfortable. It’s time to wake up. Because your life is not some future event. Your life is now.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“I’m a huge believer in humanity. I wake up and look at my children and I see something that’s so pure; at that age they don’t know what violence is; and they don’t know how to hate yet. And I think that is what inspires me to do the things that I do.”Marc ChingThis week’s guest is a straight up hero.One of the most courageous and committed animal rights activists I have ever met, Marc Ching (@animalhopeandwellness) is the founder of Animal Hope and Wellness Foundation, a non-profit devoted to the rescue and rehabilitation of dogs abused and often tortured at the hands of the Asian dog meat trade.A family man, successful small business owner and animal lover who has been treating dogs (and humans) for years as a holistic nutritionist, in 2011 Marc began using his skills to rescue and rehabilitate abused dogs in need and place them into homes — work he does primarily in and around his home in Los Angeles.But Marc’s evolution into an ardent animal rights activist didn’t begin until 2015, when he heard about something called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival in China.He understood that dog meat is simply part of the regional cuisine across many parts of Asia. What he didn’t understand were the reports of mistreatment and abuse. So he decided to infiltrate the festival to learn more.What Marc discovered was an utterly horrific, systemic practice of torture far more pervasive than anything he could have previously imagined.Life for Marc would never be the same again.According to the Humane Society, 30 million dogs are slaughtered every year across Asia with an estimated 10 million per year in China alone. A significant portion of these animals are brutally tortured — often burned and boiled alive prior to death — a practice attributable to the bizarre and misguided belief that tortured dog meat tastes better and provides enhanced health benefits.Let that sink in for a moment.Attending Yulin transformed Marc from an essentially normal, suburban family man into a man obsessed. Over the last two years, Marc has devoted all his free time and resources to combating the Asian dog meat trade. Posing undercover as as a wealthy dog meat buyer, he has traveled extensively across China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, South Korea and Indonesia to document and expose the inhuman practices of this barbaric industry.This is dangerous work. Marc has been chased, harassed, beat up and even shot. But to date, he has saved over 1,000 dogs, many on his own dime. More importantly, his work has been essential in catalyzing global awareness of dog meat trade practices, which in turn has led to legislative and regulatory reform.There is something undoubtedly heroic about Marc. But it’s a heroism that comes at a cost. This work has traumatized him. Perhaps even permanently damaged him. He’s made peace with the trade-off. Maybe that makes him even more heroic. I don’t know.Mark’s work has been extensively profiled in outlets that include the New York Times, Forbes, Entrepreneur, The Hollywood Reporter, The Telegraph, The Independent, Buzzfeed, and even Breitbart.It’s an honor to celebrate the difficult work that Marc does. My hope is that this conversation will raise additional awareness around wrongs we must collectively work to correct.NOTE: The subject matter of today’s conversation is disturbing. It’s an emotional conversation that traverses sensitive issues. That said, I believe it’s an important conversation to have as conscious, global citizens. A conversation I don’t think we can or should shy away from.On that note, I encourage all of you to listen and listen with an open mind.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“I don’t want to be better than you or her or him—I want to be better than I am right now.”Kerri Walsh JenningsThe most decorated beach volleyball player in history and one of the most consistently dominant Olympic athletes of all time, Kerri Walsh Jennings (@kerrileewalsh) needs no introduction. But for those few off-grid souls who somehow avoided the last five Olympiads, here’s but a taste of what this week’s guest has accomplished:This is a unique and extraordinary exploration of the habits, practices and mindset behind one of the greatest athletes on the planet.It’s a conversation about the mentality required to be the world’s best. It’s an exchange about the crucial role effective communication plays in both sport and relationships. And it’s about the power and responsibility of being a positive role model.But ultimately, this is a conversation about pursuing what you love, loving what you pursue, and taking a stand for what you believe in.I cannot overstate my respect for Kerri, her athletic achievements, and how this delightful, spirited, beautiful and tenacious human lives her life on a daily basis.

December 5, 2016

“No one else is responsible for your well being…take control of your own health.”John LewisBeyond the chiseled arms and imposing six-foot six physique, the thing you notice most about this week’s guest is his smile — a smile the size of Texas that only hints at the even bigger heart within.But John Lewis wasn’t always the exemplary model of health and advocacy he is today. Tipping the scales at 315 pounds by his freshman year in high school, things could have easily gone sideways for this young man growing up in Ferguson, Missouri.But instead of drugs and gangs, he turned to sports, finding solace and refuge in basketball and football. Honing his skills in both high school and college helped him ditch his fat kid image and triggered his life-long love for healthy living.Nonetheless, John began experiencing some serious, negative health issues despite maintaining an athletic nature post-college. He sought medical advice and was informed that excessive animal protein consumption just might be the culprit. That advice, combined with his mother’s colon cancer diagnosis, catalyzed an experiment with vegetarianism. Little did he know, that experiment would change his life.In short shrift, ditching meat resolved his health issues. More importantly, the lifestyle aligned with his values. So it wasn’t long before John jettisoned all animal products from his plate and went entirely vegan.Needless to say, this was an unlikely move for a football loving gym rat. His friends were not amused.But John never felt better. The lights went on, opening him to an entirely new way of living and being that brought his life path into focus.Today, John is an in-demand public speaker, personal trainer, and entrepreneur tirelessly spreading his his broad smile as the Bad Ass Vegan — busting traditional stereotypes as an entirely new breed of vegan evangelist with a unique ability to communicate and positively impact a wide diversity of people.He has appeared on multiple television shows and been profiled in several magazines, including Muscle & Fitness, Men’s Fitness, Fitness Rx, Vegan Health & Fitness, Thrive, Origin, Maxim and even Sports Illustrated. You might have seen him flexing in all those P90X television ads that were ubiquitous a few years back.Beyond the nickname, Bad Ass Vegan is also John’s apparel and lifestyle brand — a health and nutrition company striving to upend traditional notions that surround what it means — and what it looks like — to be vegan by educating individuals on plant-based nutrition and more conscious living.I first met John a couple years ago and always enjoy spending time with him at various lifestyle events — his energy is beyond infectious. So I’m proud to share his powerful, super uplifting message with you today.This is a conversation about taking personal responsibility for ourselves, our well being, and our life paths. It’s about the impact of mindset on personal destiny. It’s about the power of community. And it’s a conversation about the power we all possess to positively transform ourselves and make a real difference in those we touch.We cover a lot of ground in this conversation, including:I sincerely hope you enjoy our exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

November 28, 2016

“Run when you can, walk if you have to, crawl if you must; just never give up.”Dean KarnazesPicking up where we left off exactly two years ago, today’s podcast marks the return of ultramarathon legend Dean Karnazes.For the select few unfamiliar with a man whose name has become synonymous with running, let’s break it down:Hailed by TIME as one of the Top 100 Most Influential People in the World, Dean is a New York Times bestselling author of several books and perhaps Earth’s most recognized ultra-distance running specialist – a global ambassador of sport who has pushed his body, mind and spirit beyond places most people simply cannot fathom.Dean’s mind-bending feats of two-legged prowess include:I met Dean back in 2011 and we’ve been friends ever since. In 2013, I even helped crew him to his 10th Badwater 135 finish. Today we reunite to pickup where we left off in RRP 115 — one of my most popular podcasts to date — to discuss life, running, his latest adventures, and his brand new book, The Road To Sparta: Reliving the Ancient Battle and Epic Run That Inspired the World’s Greatest Footrace*.This is the book Dean was born to write.It’s the story of Dean’s ancestral heritage and his deeply personal, genetically hardwired connection to the intrepid ancient Greek ultrarunners known as hemerodromes.It’s also the incredibly well researched historical account of Pheidippides — perhaps the greatest and most heroic hemerodrome of all time — and the crucial role he played in helping Athens defeat Persia in the Battle of Marathon that took place 2,500 years ago. Pheidippides’ 153-mile, 36 hour run from Athens to Sparta in 490 B.C. wasn’t just critical to Greek victory, it’s fair to say it spared Western Civilization and preserved the democratic institutions we so value today.Finally, the book is a deeply engaging, first-hand account of Dean’s attempt to honor his lauded hemerodrome ancestor by replicating Pheidippides’ ancient and historic 153-mile run, training and racing on only the few foods actually available to Pheidippides at the time.Beyond fascinating tales from the new book, this is a conversation about curiosity, consistency, and drive. It’s about out-of-body experiences that occur when you are stripped to your very core. It’s about what motivates him to continue pushing the boundaries of human capabilities well into his 50’s and how his training, racing and nutrition have evolved to meet that challenge.But most of all, this is a conversation about what it means to be truly alive – and the beautiful embrace of discomfort required to explore the outer limits of performance, potential, and human experience.I consider Dean a role model. In addition to being one of the great athletes of our time and an inspiration to millions worldwide, Dean is someone I am lucky to call friend and mentor. I’m thrilled to further share his life, wisdom and experience with you today.I sincerely hope you enjoy our exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

November 21, 2016

“If you want extreme results, you need to do extreme things.”Andrew “Spud Fit” TaylorOne of the great privileges of hosting this podcast is the occasional opportunity it presents to shift focus from conversations with globally prominent thought leaders to shine a bright spotlight on the struggles and triumphs of the everyman.Folks living average, relatable lives. Anonymous individuals dealing with issues all too many of us confront and combat — obesity, depression, disease, addiction and/or a sense of general dissatisfaction with their current life status. Authentic souls who reach the limit of their pain threshold and cross that tipping point to finally proclaim,enough is enough.On a personal note, nothing gives me more satisfaction than celebrating those who courageously challenge their life paradigm, step outside the cozy comfort zone, and attempt the extraordinary — all in the interest of gaining control of their well being and seizing the reigns of their life path.Folks like Josh LaJaunie, who lost over 200 pounds to conquer ultramarathons and even grace the cover of this month’s Runners World magazine. Or Brett & David Wilcox – the father-son duo who ran across the USA to raise GMO awareness. Luke Tyburski fits the bill — a guy who overcame depression to conquer The Ultimate Triathlon. And I’d add Adam Sud to that list — a young guy who kicked adderal, reversed his diabetes and found a life.Sharing these experiences is what makes this podcast different from the others — meaningful and special in a very unique way.So if you enjoy the uplifting everyman story, then you are in for a treat today.About a year ago, Andrew Taylor stepped onto the scale — 334 pounds. The Aussie didn’t like what he saw. He didn’t like how he felt. Clinically depressed, medicated and hopelessly addicted to unhealthy foods, his elevator was going down — fast.Fed up and sick & tired of being sick & tired, he drew a line in the sand and decided to step over it.It was time to finally wake up and seize the reigns of his physical, mental and emotional health and well being. To once and for all reclaim the life he felt quickly slipping away.Blessed with self-awareness, he saw his path to freedom would lay not in balance but rather in what most would consider drastic and extreme measures.Andrew decided that he would eat nothing but potatoes for an entire year.Nothing. But. Potatoes. For an entire year.On January 2, 2016, all 334 depressed pounds of Andrew popped open his phone, clicked record, and announced his quest on YouTube — to a subscriber base of exactly zero.The single video soon morphed into a daily vlog, a raw, personal and authentic look into the highs, lows, how to’s and whatnots of a potato-fueled journey Andrew dubbed Spud Fit.He presumed nobody would care. This was for him. Surprisingly, the world took notice. It wasn’t long before the global media picked up Andrew’s personal interest story and before he could even blink, his wild adventure was foisted into the white hot spotlight.Over the last year, Andrew has been profiled in countless publications — everything from The Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph to Buzzfeed. The Today Show did a story on him. He even made an appearances TV’s The Doctors.As he nears the end of his one year experiment in radical dietary simplicity, Andrew has overcome his depression. He’s off his meds. And has lost 114lbs.I’m proud to share Andrew’s wild and crazy story with you today.This is much more than a conversation about what it’s like to only eat potatoes. It’s a conversation about the pitfalls of moderation and the shortcomings of balance. It’s about the incredible courage required to shuck the rule book, challenge the paradigm, stomp on the comfort zone, step way outside the box and attempt something extraordinary.But ultimately, this is a powerful discourse on the power we all possess — but all too often deny or overlook — to access and unleash untapped reservoirs of human potential to positively control our health and and radically course correct the trajectory of our lives.We cover a lot of ground in this conversation, including:I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.

November 17, 2016

“Walk with integrity. Lead with love. Exude the change you want to see in this complicated, divided world.”Rich RollI have endeavored to keep politics out of this podcast. A podcast proudly built on radical inclusivity that transcends political ideology and affiliation.That said, in the wake of last week, many have solicited my perspective on what I think we can all agree is a historic election — perhaps the most jolting and important political event of our lifetimes.So today, I officially go on record.I’m nervous. Because my truth may not be your truth. But know that I welcome our differences.I do this because I stand for fidelity to authenticity. And authenticity requires I give voice to my truth.I do this with eyes wide open. I understand and accept that I very well may be committing social media suicide.I do this because I am dismayed by the extent to which we are divided as a people.I do this because fear runs rampant. Because discord rules the conversation. Because facts have been rendered irrelevant. Because fundamental rights are being threatened. Because dignity is being trampled. Because science is under siege. And because precious environmental protections are imperiled.I do this to provide counsel for those suffering.I do this to build a bridge to those celebrating.I do this from a desire to better understand.I do this from a place of love.So let’s have a conversation about it. About all of it. A real conversation.Today I convene with Julie Piatt and activist filmmaker Darly Wein for a raw and candid roundtable discourse on how to best process, move forward and come together in this most divisive, uncertain time.The answer to what ails us transcends politics. It lives beyond our respective idealogical bubbles. It’s an answer that will only be found in the desire to better understand ourselves and each other. In the search for unity. In self-governance and taking responsibility for our actions, our words, and our behavior. Beyond the fear that blinds us, it will be discovered only when we learn to walk with integrity, stop fighting and listen — really listen — with compassion. With empathy. And love.Always love.I sincerely hope you find this conversation helpful. Should you choose to pass on this episode (I get it), regular programming will resume on Monday.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“The prize never goes to the fastest guy; it goes to the guy who slows down the least.”Chris HauthThis week marks the highly anticipated return of Chris Hauth to the podcast.A sub-9 hour Ironman, Chris (@AIMPCoach) is the current Age Group Ironman World Champion, a former Olympic Swimmer and one of the world’s most respected endurance coaches. In 2006, Chris won the Ironman Coeur D’Alene and went on to be the first American amateur & 4th overall American at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii.When he’s not training and racing, Chris expertly coaches a wide spectrum of amateur and elite professional athletes across a variety of disciplines, including Ironman and Western States top finishers, Ultraman winners and myriad swimmers towards age group nationals and Olympic Trials.My relationship with Chris began in 2008. A coach/athlete mentorship turned friendship that profoundly and forever altered the trajectory of my life. Brilliantly guiding me through three Ultraman World Championships (’08, ’09 & ’11) as well as EPIC5 in 2010, my debt of gratitude for Chris’ tutelage cannot be overstated. Simply put, I could have never achieved the level of athletic success I have enjoyed without his deft counsel, which has been instrumental in maximizing my potential as an athlete and bettering me as a human being.Today I am pleased to share his wisdom with you.This is a general conversation about Chris’ evolving philosophy on training, racing and life. It’s also a granular and technical masterclass on optimal training protocols, the common mistakes most athletes make, the approach and mindset required to break the glass ceiling on potential, and how to effectively balance performance goals against general health and well-being.But at it’s core, this is a conversation about multi-sport as a crucible for self-awareness and growth.Endurance sports as metaphor for life. We cover a lot of ground in this conversation, including:I have an inkling this episode will leave you wanting to hear more about Chris’ story and philosophy.

“If you’re not personally invested in what you’re working on, you’ll fail.”Biz StoneImagine co-creating a tool so powerful, it literally changes the world.Biz Stone is one such man.Most people know Biz as one of the co-founders of Twitter. Together @biz @jack and @ev created the social media behemoth that seismically impacted how we connect with the world, share information, exchange opinions, consume news, and participate in the daily global conversation.Ironically, Biz never aspired to become successful in business. A most unlikely entrepreneur, he spent his early years as an artist, crafting book covers for a Boston publishing house.Biz’s initial interest in Silicon Valley was sparked not by the potential for riches but rather by idealism – technology as potential energy to greater unite the human experience. Bring people closer. And cultivate global cooperation.An early evangelist of blogging as a vehicle to serve his romantic vision, Biz jumped when Ev Williams invited him to join Blogger, the networked blogging platform Ev had built and sold to Google.Ultimately, Biz walked away from Google. Leaving millions on the table, he leaped into the treacherous unknown of start ups, following Ev to podcast precursor Odeo. In one of the greatest pivots in Silicon Valley lore, Odeo would morph into Twitter. Twitter would permanently change culture. And along with Ev, Biz would later advance to co-found Medium, the über-popular, user-friendly blogging platform of the moment.Today brings us to Jelly, a new kind of multi-platform search engine Biz recently launched that allows you to ask questions and get timely, helpful answers (as opposed to an index of websites) from the people most well suited to intelligently respond. It’s fun and surprisingly effective. Give it a try by downloading the iOS app, visiting askjelly.com/richroll, or just add #askjelly to your Twitter questions.Among his accolades, INC. Magazine named Biz Entrepreneur of the Decade. TIME listed him as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World, GQ named him Nerd of the Year, and he’s one of Vanity Fair’s Top Ten Most Influential People of the Information Age. Despite never graduating college, today Biz serves up Visiting and Executive Fellow duties at both Oxford and Berkeley respectively and authored the humorous memoir, Things A Little Bird Told Me.Beyond the narrative of inhabiting rare entrepreneurial air, what’s most personally interesting about Biz is that at his core, he really is an artist. A true artist. Not one for the sexy stories of Silicon Valley board room intrigue, what excites Biz most is leveraging his fertile, creative mind to serve humanity. To make the world better. More connected. More empathetic.This is a fun, jocular conversation about conscious capitalism, the future of tech and artificial intelligence. It’s about living in alignment with one’s values. It’s about the future of one man’s dedication to cultivating greater human cooperation. And it’s a conversation about what it takes to change the world. Like, indubitably.Oh yeah – he’s also super funny.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation. Give Biz a shout on Twitter at @biz and let him know what you think.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

October 31, 2016

“The things you own end up owning you.”Tyler DurdenI thought it would make me happy.So, I studied hard. Nailed the grades & aced my college applications — 7 for 7. Even Harvard gave me the green light. I snagged a degree from Stanford, eked my way through Cornell Law School, bagged the fancy job, worked ridiculous hours in overpriced suits and rode the elevator all the way up the corporate ladder, hammering impressive paychecks along the way.Prosperity? I guess. Security? Maybe. Personal satisfaction?Not so much.Don’t get me wrong. The American Dream is a beautiful ideal. An egalitarian proposition I bought into wholesale, forging a life trajectory premised upon material well being. But the dream is not without it’s fissures. Nowhere does it promise personal well being. Nowhere does it promise meaning. Nowhere does it promise happiness.But this is on me. Because at no point did I take action on anything of personal importance. What do I want? Who do I want to be? At 30, I lacked the maturity and self-awareness to honestly answer these questions. But let’s face it — I didn’t even ask.At first, my dissatisfaction was barely noticeable. But as my disquieting malaise progressively escalated, I compensated with all manner of unhealthy habits. Blackout binges that landed me in jail. Horrendously noxious food that left me atrociously unhealthy. Spending sprees that escalated my debt to almost un-fixable levels.Nothing worked. So I drank more, ate more, spent more, consumed more. Yet no matter how overindulgent my insalubrious habits, how desperate my accelerating efforts to medicate my discomforting dis-ease of self became, that hole in my spirit just grew. Deeper. Wider. Darker. Until it’s sheer vastness swallowed me whole, leaving me lost, despondent and utterly alone.Hoping to die and unable to live, all that remained was the realm of the hungry ghost.I honestly don’t know how or why I survived. But I do know my rebirth was not by my hand. My divine moment was just that – divine. A faint whisper from the dark recesses of my rootless, discomposed consciousness:You don’t have to live this way anymore.This week’s guest knows a thing or two about what I’m talking about. Because not that many years ago, Joshua Fields Milburn was blazing a similar trajectory. Mired in the corporate grind, he chased the American Dream banking six figures managing 150 telecom retail stores, expiating for the satisfaction his career failed to provide by doing what we do — accumulating. And when that didn’t work, he accumulated more.In fact — much like me — the more Joshua measured self-worth via the barometer of externalities like job titles, condos, and big screen tv’s, the more his hole darkened, dilating in depth, width and scope.Joshua’s divine moment was delivered in the sudden passing of his mother, followed quickly by the dissolution of his marriage. A devastating succession of events that forced him to take a long look in the mirror. Despondent with the guy being reflected back to him, a whisper began to echo:You don’t have to live this way anymore.Hence was born Joshua’s search for a more fulfilling and personally satisfying way of living and being. A search that ultimately illuminated a beacon in the darkest of nights.Minimalism.It began with unshackling his relationship to material things. But it culminated in something far more profound: freedom.In Joshua’s words, freedom from fear. Freedom from worry. Freedom from overwhelm. Freedom from guilt. Freedom from depression. Freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around. Real freedom.Today, Joshua and his best friend Ryan Nicodemus are The Minimalists — a dynamic duo that write, speak, make films and generally espouse the virtues of focusing on life’s most important things—which actually aren’t things at all.With a devoted readership in the millions, they’ve written several books, given TED Talks and spoken at places like SXSW and Harvard Business School. They’ve been featured on every major television network and profiled in major publications like The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and TIME.They created a publishing imprint, launched a podcast, opened a coffee house and even made a stupendously great documentary called, you guessed it, Minimalism: A Documentary.Packed with teachable moments and brilliant takeaways, this is a phenomenal conversation about how to live more deliberately. It’s about creating more by consuming less. It’s about prioritizing experience over accumulation. It’s about reclaiming our precious time. It’s about discovering meaning. It’s about growth, contentment and love. And it’s about the deep personal satisfaction that comes with contributing beyond ourselves.But most of all, this is a conversation about, to coin Joshua’s brilliant phrase, why we should love people and use things. Because the opposite never works.Joshua and his message are a gift. My hope is that you receive it graciously, reflect upon it appreciatively, then put it to work.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

306,Dr. Michael Gervais,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/michael-gervais-2/,"Episode 252
October 23, 2016

“There’s no such thing as a big moment, there’s just another moment.”Michael GervaisAt the highest echelon of elite performance, all the athletes possess otherworldly talent. Their thirst for glory is equally preternatural. All of them train to the outer limits of physical possibility. And they are all extraordinarily adroit at focusing on almost inhuman, impossible goals.So what accounts for the distance between the Olympic gold medalist standing proudly atop the podium and the athlete watching the games on television at home?Is it luck? Talent? Support? Resources? Of course every result is significantly influenced by some combination of these important variables. But all things being equal, the difference between the champion and the also ran boils down to one distinct variable:The mind.Once the embarrassing last stop on a flailing athlete’s career, the world’s top sports psychologists now enjoys a highly influential and respected role proactively honing the mental and emotional edge of today’s most successful athletes, CEOs and creatives looking to elevate peak performance beyond the imaginable.Enter Dr. Michael Gervais — the go to high performance psychologist everyone is talking about.A key member of the Red Bull High Performance Program, Michael works in the trenches of high-stakes environments with some of the world’s most prolific Olympic and professional athletes — rare air where there is no luxury for mistakes, hesitation, or failure to respond.Dr. Gervais’ results are beyond impressive. If you follow the NFL, then you might recall Michael as the guy Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll credits as integral in their 2014 Super Bowl win for the meditation, mindfulness and other crucial team building techniques he helped foster and instill into the fabric of the Seahawks organization and team culture that paved the team’s path towards incredible success.You might also remember that Felix Baumgartner’s now-infamous Red Bull Stratos jump from an altitude of 128,000 feet almost never was simply because Felix simply could not overcome the high level of anxiety and claustrophobia he experienced every time he donned the jump suit. It was none other than Gervais who helped Baumagartner resolve the issue and get Stratos back on track. No Gervais, no history making jump.And more recently, Michael is the man behind Luke Aikins, who astonished the world this past July by becoming the first skydiver to jump from a plane at 25,000 feet without a parachute or wingsuit and live to tell the story.Dr. Gervais has also worked intimately with US Olympic Team members like beach volleyball superstar Kerry Walsh Jennings, as well as swimmers, snowboarders, golfers, basketball players, track and field athletes, an impressive array of top collegiate programs, and professional sports organizations including the NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB and UFC. In addition, his work has played an integral role in the US Military, as well as several collegiate and high school programs.While Dr. Gervais’ roster includes some of the sports world’s most elite, this isn’t just about high performance athletes.Whether you are an athlete or a weekend warrior, an executive or a stay-at-home parent, it’s about transcending our self-imposed limitations to unlock dormant potential to unleash your unique, most authentic life.Because everyday, every one of us — irrespective of circumstance — has the opportunity to create a living masterpiece.Today marks my second conversation with Michael. Picking up where we left off in December 2014 (RRP 120), this conversation delves deeper into Michael’s life, experience and message, further canvassing the psychological topography of performance and even probing some surprisingly mystical terrain.We cover a lot of ground in this conversation, including:At it’s core, this is a conversation about self mastery. A state of being that isn’t about motivation. And has nothing to do with winning. It’s about courage. It’s about pursuing the razor’s edge of what’s possible. It’s about belief.And it’s about love.A very special human, Michael is truly one of my favorite people and this conversation reveals why. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed having it. And while you’re at it, make a point of subscribing to his podcast. A unique mining of the mindsets behind high performers across a diversity of disciplines, Finding Mastery stands alone.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

307,Rob Bell,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rob-bell/,"Episode 251
October 16, 2016

“It’s not that you have a spiritual life. You are a spiritual life.”Rob BellReligion was never for me. Despite many a youthful hour spent kneeling on hardwood church pews, it just never connected.What do all those stained glass windows, depressing organ dirges, and uptight people have to do with art and beauty and meaning and love and purpose and mystery and ultimately what it means to be human?Nothing as far as I could tell. So I searched for answers elsewhere. In the bottom of a bottle. Prowling underground after parties in lower Manhattan. In a mental institution called rehab. In midnight conversations with skid row junkies. In the sound of my breath, lost on a mountain trail run at dawn. During afternoons spent undulating with dolphins in Hawaii. In the overwhelming love I feel simply watching my children sleep.My search didn’t lead back to religion. But it did lead to faith. A deep faith of my own design. Faith in an undefined, unlimited power greater than myself. A faith that quite literally saved my life when I was utterly lost, completely broken and unconditionally beyond repair. A faith that has since infused my journey with meaning, purpose and satisfaction beyond my wildest imagination.Some call my version of faith God. Call it whatever you like. I don’t care.What I do care about is what it really means to be a spiritual being having a human experience.This week’s guest has a few thoughts on the subject — an anti-establishment pastor provocateur making an indelible cultural impact on how we think and practice divinity, faith, and religion in the modern world.Named one of 2011’s 100 Most Influential People in the World by Time Magazine, Rob Bell has presided over mega congregations, toured with Oprah and been profiled in The New Yorker. iTunes named his podcast, The RobCast, one of the Best of 2015 and he has penned more than a handful of New York Times bestsellers, including Love Wins, the Oprah book of the month What We Talk About When We Talk about God*, and his most recent book, How To Be Here: A Guide to Creating a Life Worth Living*.To me, what makes Rob so undeniably captivating is his independent-minded, radically inclusive — almost punk rock — perspective on faith. Breaking ranks with entrenched, pedantic notions of antiquated Christian church doctrine, his message upends the divisive aspects of religious ideology, recontextualizing the canon as a highly relatable, welcome pallium for all — a comprehensive fiat that boils down to one central premise:Love wins. Always.These days, Rob’s oratory of choice isn’t of the gothic variety. Instead, he prefers to deliver his populist homilies in voguey venues like comedy and improv clubs, including a standing appointment at Largo, Hollywood’s buzzworthy alternative event space known more for indie rock acts like Fiona Apple, Elliot Smith and Rufus Wainwright than some ecclesiastic waxing on about God and man’s place in the universe.I’ve never met anyone quite like Rob — seriously, what kind of pastor loves surfing and Sigur Rós? Blasphemy!Incredibly warm and irresistibly inviting, Rob prompted one of the most interesting and engaging exchanges I have ever had on the subject of faith. It’s a conversation about humility, spirituality and God. It’s about why religion has failed so many. And it’s about love.Because everything is spiritual.It was an absolute delight spending a few hours with Rob. I love everything about this exchange. I hope you do too.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

308,Jonathan Fields,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/jonathan-fields-2/,"Episode 250
October 10, 2016

“The only road to success is just sustained action over a longer window of time.”Jonathan FieldsSome people exude a calm, confident quietude. Others exuberantly burst with exciting ideas. But it’s the rare individual that combines understated self-assurance with a spark so powerful, it incites lasting positive change in all who enter his orbit.Jonathan Fields is one such human.His mission? To humanize and empower the process of creation. To help people and organizations conceive and build better, more conscious businesses, art, and lives in less time, with more joy and less effort.On a personal level, Jonathan is guy I can deeply relate to – a dad and husband who (like me) decided to leave the gilded, protective hallways of mega-law firm life and risk everything in search of a life path of greater meaning for himself and others.Reinventing himself as a socially conscious, serial entrepreneur and mindful innovation strategist, today Jonathan is an A-list blogger, award-winning author, speaker, and founder of Good Life Project –empowering people to live more engaged and connected lives via a global education and multi-media venture that encompasses video projects, his wildly popular podcast and super cool events like Camp GLP, his annual 3 1/2- day retreat that blends friendship, adventure and deep-learning with strategies and tools for accelerated personal and business growth.Beneath it all, Jonathan is a teacher. Brimming with empowering wisdom, I love his focus on process over results. His emphasis on the journey over the destination. His deep understanding that authenticity is everything. And that mindfulness lays forth the path. This powerful ethos is reflected in everything Jonathan does, from his writing and advocacy to most importantly, how he conducts his life down to the smallest details.Jonathan has been featured in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, FastCompany, Inc., Entrepreneur, Forbes, USA Today, CNBC, CNN.com, PBS Nightly Report, Elle, Self, Fitness, Vogue, O, People and thousands of other websites that sound cool, but (in Jonathan’s words) don’t impress his daughter all that much.His first book, Career Renegade: How to Make a Great Living Doing What You Love*, was named a Top 10 Small Business Book by Small Business Trends and a Top 5 Summer Read by MSNBC. Fields’ second book, Uncertainty: Turning Fear and Doubt Into Fuel for Brilliance*, was lauded as the #1 Personal Development book of 2011 by 800-CEO-READ.This week marks the release of Jonathan’s highly anticipated new book, How to Live a Good Life: Soulful Stories, Surprising Science, and Practical Wisdom*. I was lucky enough to get an advance copy (one of the perks of hosting a podcast) and I loved it. Packed with insightful, straightforward guidance, what I like best is Jonathan’s eminently doable approach for unleashing dormant potential and the authentic self lurking within.This week marks Jonathan’s second appearance on the podcast (check out RRP 74 for our initial chat), and this time we raise the bar — a powerful conversation about the importance of community. How to let go and be present. It’s an exchange about the significance of morning routines, the fallacy of balance and the virtues of consistency. It’s about the role of belonging in life. The importance of embodied teachers. And it’s a heartfelt deep dive into Jonathan’s three buckets for living a good life.Truth be told, I could talk with Jonathan all day. After this conversation, I think you’ll feel the same. I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

309,Sacha Gervasi & David De Rothschild,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/sacha-gervasi-david-de-rothschild/,"Episode 249
October 3, 2016

“Curiosity is one of the greatest drivers of change.”David de RothschildTwo British ex-pats walk into a room. One, a writer and filmmaker. The other, a global adventurer and environmentalist. Upon cursory glance, it’s an odd pairing — two exceedingly talented and accomplished yet very different people with little in common beyond their homeland of origin.But peer just beneath the surface and you’ll quickly discover certain common passions unite them. A zeal for chasing dreams. An appreciation for cultivating imagination. And a deep understanding that a story well told holds the potential energy to change the world.My very good friend for over 16 years, Sacha Gervasi is the hyper-charismatic screenwriter behind the Steven Spielberg-Tom Hanks vehicle The Terminal and the director of 2012’s Academy Award nominated Hitchcock, starring Anthony Hopkins, Helen Mirren and Scarlett Johannson.But Sacha is perhaps best known for Anvil! The Story of Anvil — his critically acclaimed rockumentary about an also-ran Canadian heavy metal band. A true-to-life Spinal Tap the London Times dubbed possibly the greatest film ever made about rock and roll, it took independent cinema by storm at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008 and would go on to win both an Emmy and Independent Spirit Award. But behind the film’s can you believe this is actually real? narrative and comedically endearing head-banger protagonists is a powerful, indelible dissection of what it truly means to never give up on your dream.Equally charismatic is Sacha’s brother-in-law, David de Rothschild. A world adventurer, passionate environmentalist, entrepreneur and provocative storyteller, David spearheads more conscious causes, mind-boggling expeditions and well deserving non-profits than you can possibly count.In between writing books and graphic novels, David has traipsed the Arctic from Russia to Canada, is one of only 14 people to have traversed the continent of Antarctica and was part of the team that broke the world record for the fastest-ever crossing of the Greenland ice cap.Named an Emerging Explorer by National Geographic, a Climate Hero by the United Nations and Man of the Year by GQ Magazine, David is perhaps best known for sailing from San Francisco to Sydney in a 60-foot catamaran forged from 125,000 intact, reclaimed plastic bottles. Dubbed Plastiki — an homage to Kon-Tiki, legendary explorer Thor Heyerdal’s epic 4,300-mile crossing of the Pacific on a balsawood raft in 1947 — the hair-raising odyssey was a successful effort to captivate awareness around the 73.9 million pounds of plastic currently floating in our oceans.David’s latest obsession? The Lost Explorer — his recently launched line of stylish, sustainably sourced and manufactured garments, grooming products and travel accessories.The three of us convened in David’s spectacular, airy Venice live-work loft for a proper chat and spot of tea. Between witty barbs, this conversation pivots on a central theme: the power of storytelling to lift the human spirit, speak truth to power, incite positive change and elicit indelible, eternal verities  about who we are. And how, together, we can leverage imagination to cultivate a better relationship with nature and a brighter future for ourselves, our children and the planet at large.Specific topics explored include:I barely scratch the surface on what makes each of these remarkable humans tick. So I promise to soon bring both David and Sacha back individually for a more in-depth probing. That said, I adore both of these men and I love this conversation.

310,Charlie Engle,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/charlie-engle/,"Episode 248
September 25, 2016

“It doesn’t matter what happens to you. All that matters is what you do with what happens to you.”Charlie EngleThere is extreme. Then there’s Charlie Engle – a man who has run across deserts, summited ice-covered volcanoes, swam with crocodiles, overcome crack addiction and survived a stint in federal prison.The story goes like this: after a hair-curling, decade-long love affair with booze and crack cocaine that culminated in a near-fatal six-day binge and a hail of bullets, Charlie finally gets sober. For solace, he turns to running, which becomes his lifeline, his pastime, and his salvation. He begins with marathons, but it wasn’t enough. Ultramarathons soon became the focus of his affection, a new love affair that takes him to stunning heights and accolades.During this second act, Charlie would clock a handful of impressive top-10 finishes at prestigious races like Badwater, a 135-mile jaunt across Death Valley widely considered to be the toughest footrace on Earth. But his athletic zenith is an unprecedented, absolutely astonishing 111-day, 4,500-mile run across the Sahara Desert — a feat chronicled in the Matt Damon narrated documentary entitled Running the Sahara.Life was pretty good.Then came quite possibly the most bizarre and improbable challenge Charlie could ever imagine facing. A bad B-movie narrative that involved an obsessed IRS agent with an axe to grind. Wire taps and garbage probes. Even the requisite wily enchantress dispatched to entrap. A saga that culminates in an unjust conviction for mortgage fraud.A poster child for everything awry with the mortgage-backed security crisis, Charlie serves 16 months in a West Virginia federal prison – what Charlie jocularly refers to as his federal holiday.He could have played the victim. Instead, he spends his days pounding the small prison track, running endlessly in circles. Soon his fellow inmates were joining him, struggling to keep their spirits up in dehumanizing circumstances.A prison hero by the time his sentence concludes, Charlie now embraces his third act as a more fully actualized version of his pre-shackled self — armed with newfound perspective and a grateful appreciation for what matters most in life.Charlie is one-of-a-kind. A world class talker and master storyteller, I knew Charlie’s new memoir would be a page-turner. But I didn’t expect the book to be so well written. Running Man: A Memoir* is every bit the gripping, raw, honest, funny, emotional, at times cringe-inducing, but ultimately inspiring story I hoped it would be – and then some.I’m thrilled to bring you my second conversation with Charlie. Picking up where episode 67 leaves off, (a must listen if you’re new to the show), this is an intimate discourse about high highs and low lows. It’s about addiction, sobriety, service and spirit. It’s about perspective. Nine lives and third acts. What it means to touch the threshold of human endurance.And then transcend it.Specific topics discussed include:I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

September 18, 2016

“We often feel paralyzed by choice and make no choice. But the thing is, no choice is a choice.”Chris GuillebeauIn the mid-1800’s, this radical dude living alone in the woods famously wrote, the mass of men lead lives of quite desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation.As set forth in the enduring Walden, the words of Henry David Thoreau were revelatory for the time. But it’s an idea that more than holds up. Not only do I consider it daily, I would contend it perfectly encapsulates what has become the unfortunate, yet defining affliction of modern man.This week’s guest has devoted his life to helping others avoid Thoreau’s foreboding lament – a self-experiment in purposeful living he calls The Art of Non-Conformity.Ripe with wanderlust after a 4-year stint as a NGO volunteer executive in West Africa, Chris Guillebeau embarked on a multi-year quest to travel to every country in the world, all 193, before his 35th birthday. Along the way, he decided to share his adventures on a newly hatched blog. But what began as a rather ignored and somewhat turgid travelogue soon morphed into a globally revered portal chronicling the personal experience, lessons and wisdom earned and learned not just by Chris, but by a dynamic multitude of unconventional people overcoming conventional social mores around work, life and travel to achieve personal goals and greater life satisfaction.The blog exploded, capturing the intrigue, trust and fascination of people all across the world thirsty for the brass tacks steps and inspiration required to pursue more adventurous and personally fulfilling means of working and living outside traditional paradigms.With the success of the blog, it’s not surprising that books soon followed. The Art of Non-Conformity* was translated into more than twenty languages. His second book, The $100 Startup*, was a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller, selling more than 500,000 copies worldwide. His third book, The Happiness of Pursuit*, was also a New York Times bestseller. His most recent book, Born for This*, will help you find the work you were meant to do.When he’s not writing bestselling books or traveling to parts unknown, you’re likely to find Chris diligently working on his World Domination Summit —  an annual gathering he founded six years ago that brings thousands of creative, remarkable people together.Everybody loves a good travel hack. The basic steps to launch a new business. Or the path to overnight success. If you’re looking for Chris’ answers to those questions, you’re in the wrong place.I’m more interested in the man behind the work. What makes Chris tick. How he sees himself in the world. And how that perspective infuses his life with purpose, community, service and the strength required to continually grow and evolve.Specific topics explored include:Beyond the bullet points, this one’s special — honest, raw and real. My favorite kind of exchange.

312,Shalane Flanagan & Elyse Kopecky,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/shalane-flanagan-elyse-kopecky/,"Episode 246
September 11, 2016

“In the midst of an ordinary training day, I try to remind myself that I am preparing for the extraordinary.”Shalane FlanaganThere are people that run.There are others who run fast.But few people on Earth run like the remarkable Shalane Flanagan. Over the course of her distinguished 16-year professional career, Shalane has made 4 consecutive Olympic teams, won an Olympic medal and set a variety of American records across a wide array of distances on both the track and the road.To put her excellence in perspective, consider this: in 2010, she finished second at the prestigious New York City marathon — her very first 26.2 ever — clocking the best finish by an American female at that race in 20 years. She’s also run the fastest time ever by an American woman at the Boston Marathon and in 2014 set her personal best in Berlin with a blazing 2:21.14, the second-fastest time ever by an American woman.But what’s truly unique about this assassin in compression socks is the extraordinary extent to which Shalane has distinguished herself across a multitude of distances & disciplines. On dirt, she’s won collegiate national championships in cross-country. On the track, she’s set American records at both the 3000 & 5000 meter distances. And on the road she’s broken American records in both 10K & 15K and achieved two Olympic marathon berths, including her recent 6th place showing in Rio.Beyond her extraordinary accomplishments and amidst all her obligations as the world’s greatest running polymorph, Shalane finds herself today embarking on a new chapter — as a foster parent to twin teenage girls along with her husband Steve Edwards (a badass runner in his own right). And yet somehow, she still mustered the time to write a cookbook with her lifelong friend Elyse Kopecky – a former college cross-country teammate who left a career in digital marketing at Nike to become a chef, food writer, nutrition educator, and mom after studying culinary arts in New York and abroad.The result of Shalane and Elyse’s beautiful collaborative partnership is the newly minted New York Times’ bestselling Run Fast Eat Slow*. Part culinary primer and part lifestyle manifesto, it’s a beautiful whole foods, flavor-forward cookbook packed with nourishing and delicious recipes, nutritional wisdom and inspiring stories from two accomplished women you can’t help but love. Women who believe and prove that you can be healthy and perform at your peak without counting calories, obsessing over protein, or restricting yourself to diets that do more harm than good.As a quick aside to all my fellow passionate vegan friends (I love you), a disclaimer: Run Fast Eat Slow is not a 100% plant-based cookbook. Notwithstanding, the cookbook does contain plenty of great plant-based dishes as well as heaps of wisdom relative to cultivating a more conscious and deliberate relationship with the food we source, prepare and consume — subjects I think we can all get behind, irrespective of specific dietary preferences.In this conversation, Shalane and Elyse impart loads of practical, experience-based advice, including: Shalane’s specific training protocols, race day rituals, fueling strategies (her take on supplements might surprise you), recovery routines, mindset tactics and some of the common mistakes most runners make.More specifically, topics explored include:But beyond the pragmatic takeaways, this is a conversation about the demands of excelling at the very highest echelon of elite athletics.It’s about how to maintain enthusiasm, focus and intensity in the face of extremely high stakes and acute adversity.It’s about finding the joy in the journey.And its about empowering people to take better control of their nutrition and health.It was a pleasure speaking to Shalane and Elyse.

313,Cultivating Non-Judgment,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/how-to-cultivate-non-judgment/,"Episode 245
September 4, 2016

“As you cultivate empathy in your life the drive or compulsion to judge starts to evaporate.”Rich RollHumans love duality. But there is great beauty in the grey that lives between the lines.Black and white. Good and bad. Evolution and regression. We are hard wired to categorize. To pick a team and stick with it. It’s our way of making sense of the world. But too often this inclination to self-identify only serves to isolate and divide — working at cross-purposes with our competing desire to more deeply connect with our fellow humans.So what happens when we resist the urge to judge another? This week on the podcast Julie and I peer beyond dogma, belief systems and categories to embrace the grey.Consider it a thought experiment in forsaking judgment for empathy as a path to better understand others and the environments we co-inhabit.Specific topics include:We end the episode with a rendition of the Hedy West song 500 Miles by Julie (aka SriMati) and our boys’ band Ana Leimma.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Surrounding yourself with people that encourage and support the things that make you happy and keep you healthy and excited about life—I think that’s so important. The more we distance ourselves, and close ourselves off, the harder it is to get through all those challenges.”Alexis Fox & Micah RiskToday finds us mired in an unprecedented health and environmental crisis of cataclysmic proportions. Heart disease, America’s #1 killer, currently claims one out of every three lives. 70% of Americans are obese or overweight. By 2030, experts indicate that 30% of Americans will be diabetic or pre-diabetic.The heartbreaking culprit? SAD.But the Standard American Diet isn’t just killing people, it’s annihilating the planet. In fact, our system of industrialized animal agriculture is the #1 culprit when it comes to almost every single man made environmental ill on the planet. From mass species extinction to disappearing rainforests to giant algal ocean blooms, it’s an indefensible and unsustainable modality wrecking unrivaled havoc on our oceans, rivers, streams, soil and animals.Meet Alexis Fox and Micah Risk — two entrepreneurs leveraging cutting edge technology to turn our epidemic of SAD into an outbreak of happy, healthy and sustainable for people and the planet alike.Their solution has a name. It’s called Lighter. A powerful new online platform fueled by the latest in modern machine learning, Lighter aims to help the world eat better by leveraging the collective wisdom and experience of leading health gurus, athletes, super parents, and awe-inspiring world changers to provide everyday consumers across the globe with customized, convenient and insanely useful grocery lists, flexible weekly menus and soon even grocery delivery.It’s an ambitious goal. But not only are Alexis and Micah are up to the task, they just might be badass enough to pull it off.An accomplished athlete and mom rocking some pretty awesome tattoos, Micah is a graduate of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts with a background working with the World Health Organization. When she isn’t training with The November Project in Boston, kicking ass in marathons and ultras, or gracing the cover of Runners World magazine (she actually appeared on the RW cover an unprecedented two times in one year), she’s helping everyday people adopt sustainable healthy lifestyle solutions.Alexis is the yin to Micah’s yang. A former debate champion, improv comedian, attorney and college professor, Alexis is the former Massachusetts state director for the Humane Society. After losing 45 pounds incident to adopting a plant-based diet, she was inspired to start Lighter by her life partner Josh Balk, the co-founder of Hampton Creek — the company behind Just Mayo that is taking healthy plant-based foods to the masses.The history between this dynamic duo is fascinating. Although both of them have dedicated their entire lives to helping fix our broken food system, neither of them ever imagined that they would be running a tech company.And yet here they are — two powerful women leaders kicking ass and taking names.This is an enlightening and informative conversation about food policy and politics.It’s a comprehensive redress of our broken food system and a positive, solution-based discourse on how we can fix it.It’s a conversation about what commonly holds people back. And the vital importance of building consensus with a focus on fostering community-based support systems in the interest of helping people eat and live better.It’s conversation about female empowerment.And it’s a master class on how to ignite a social movement.But underneath it all, this is a powerful manifesto on the indelible power of every single individual to create, foster and galvanize tangible, sustainable and significant positive personal and planetary change.Specific topics covered include:Micah and Alexis are two of my favorite people and I absolutely love this conversation.

August 21, 2016

“The best feedback is what we don’t want to hear.”George RavelingOne of the most respected and revered figures in sport, George Raveling is basketball — and so much more than basketball.The current Director of International Basketball for Nike, he was the first African American basketball coach at Villanova, University of Maryland, Washington State and University of Iowa before closing out a storied career at USC.He is an inductee into several halls of fame, including the College Basketball Hall of Fame and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.He is a civil rights activist, outspoken on a wide array of social issues at the intersection of race, education and athletics.A world-class educator, he is a moulder of boys into men, and men into better men.Bottom line? George Raveling is the mentor you wish you had.But you can just call him Coach.This week I sit down with a truly remarkable man. A 79-year old with the vibrancy and energy of a college student, I was immediately struck by George’s insatiable thirst for learning. His passion for ideas. And his devotion to people, human potential & personal development.Coach has lived life. And he’s got stories to prove it. Inspirational stories about breaking racial barriers during the era of segregation. Instructive accounts of owning your destiny. And of course there’s the legendary saga of how a young George came to stand alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington as Dr. King delivered his historic I Have A Dream speech.August 28, 1963 — George Raveling (lower right, foreground) just after Martin Luther King, Jr. (middle right) delivered his famous “I Have A Dream” speech during the March on Washington.There’s so much more to this incredible story — and to George — but I’m not going to spoil it here. I’ll let Coach tell it in his own words.This is a phenomenal conversation about breaking barriers. It’s about self-governance, self-belief and self-responsibility. It’s about literacy, civil rights and humanity.And it’s about the importance of being a positive difference maker in the world.An absolute gem of a human being, George is a national treasure. I loved every second of my time with him and something tells me you will too.So take a knee and huddle up, because Coach has a message for you.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

So please consider this episode a mere first installment in what I can foresee as a series of powerful exchanges. If you enjoyed this conversation, let me know what else you would like to hear from Coach by leaving your thoughts on reddit and perhaps I can cajole him to return for some pinpointed discussions on specific topics related to human potential, performance and personal development.Listen & Subscribe on iTunes | Soundcloud | Stitcher | GooglePlay Spots are still available for our next retreat — for info visit plantpowerworld.com Check out Julie’s new podcast divine throughline Thanks to this week’s sponsors:Harrys.com: A superior shave at an affordable price. Type in my coupon code “ROLL” at purchase for $5 off your starter set and get an entire month’s worth of shaving for just $10 when you visit Harrys.com/ROLL.

August 14, 2016

“Meat consumption is just as dangerous to public health as tobacco use. It’s time we looked into holding the meat producers and fast-food outlets legally accountable.”Neal Barnard, M.D.There’s nothing I can do — it’s genetic.Without a doubt, many of us have predispositions to developing certain diseases.But predisposition is a far cry from predetermination.In fact, you might be surprised to learn the vast extent to which we can control the expression of genetic inclinations when it comes to so many of the chronic illnesses that are unnecessarily killing millions of people annually — including modern-day plagues like heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer’s.This week I’m thrilled to sit down for a long overdue conversation with my friend Neal Barnard, MD to discuss the innate, incredible power we all possess to prevent and even reverse the onset of these illnesses through implementation of fairly simple simple diet and lifestyle alternations.A pre-eminent authority on the impact of diet & nutrition on atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer’s, Dr. Barnard is an adjunct associate professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences as well as the founder and president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, where he leads programs advocating for preventive medicine, good nutrition, and higher ethical standards in medical and scientific research.Over the course of his career, Dr. Barnard has led numerous research studies investigating the effects of diet on diabetes, body weight, and chronic pain. He’s authored over 70 scientific publications as well as 17 books, including the New York Times best-sellers Power Foods for the Brain, 21-Day Weight Loss Kickstart*, and the USA Today best-seller Dr. Barnard’s Program for Reversing Diabetes*. If that’s not enough, Dr. Barnard recently christened the Barnard Medical Center, a brand new, ground-breaking non-profit primary care medical practice where board-certified physicians, nurse practitioners, and registered dietitians help patients prevent and reverse serious health problems, leveraging a holistic approach that involves tackling the actual causes of illness, with extra attention on nutrition.Chock-a-block with life-altering information, this is a profound conversation about food as medicine.It’s about the impact and importance of self-sovereignty — prioritizing personal responsibility for what we put in our mouths, how we move our bodies and advocate for change.And it’s about the incredible power of nutrition to heal ourselves.One of the most intelligent, articulate, tireless and well-respected voices on the subject of optimal wellness and disease prevention, it’s an honor and privilege to share my friend’s abundant wisdom and practical experience with you today.So break out the notepad and enjoy this powerful exchange with one of my favorite people.P.S. – Please stick around to the very end for a special treat. The show concludes with a musical performance by none other than Neal himself (who knew!). Written by Dr. Barnard and featuring him on lead guitar, Song for a Sparrow is performed by his rock band Verdun.

August 7, 2016

“I think we need to have a more evenly dispersed innovation economy and we need to make sure that anybody, anywhere, with an idea has a shot at the American dream.”Steve CaseIt’s hard to imagine, but in 1985 — the year this week’s guest co-founded America Online — only 3% of Americans were connected to the internet, online for an average of a measly one hour per week.It took a decade, many near-death experiences and back to the wall pivots, but under the leadership of Steve Case, AOL would go on to become the world’s largest and most valuable internet company, driving worldwide adoption of the medium that has literally transformed every aspect of modern day life.The story is legend. After AOL became the first internet company to go public, Bill Gates gave Steve a choice — sell his upstart to behemoth Microsoft or get crushed. Believing in himself, his team and the renegade idea of community over content, Steve decided to take his chances. David against Goliath, the odds were not in his favor. But not only did AOL survive, it went on to become the top performing stock of the 1990s. At its peak, nearly half the users in the United States used AOL to access the internet. When AOL’s valuation escalated to $163 billion in 2000, Steve negotiated a $350 billion merger of AOL and Time Warner, the largest merger in business history, and served as chairman of the media and communication colossus until 2003.It all looked great on paper. But paper isn’t reality. Cultures clashed. The stock price plummeted. With his own take on why the historic merger faltered, Steve lives to fight another day.Today Steve is chairman and CEO of Revolution, DC-based investment firm, and the Case Foundation, a philanthropic effort that invests in hundreds of organizations with an entrepreneurial approach to strengthening the social sector.The epitome of the American Entrepreneur and a true maverick of the digital age, this week I sit down with Steve to discuss his incredible story, the current state of entrepreneurship in America, and his new book highlighting an emerging new phase of the internet. Part memoir, part business playbook, and part manifesto, The Third Wave, An Entrepreneur’s Vision of The Future* bears witness to the fascinating machinations behind crafting the early stages of the internet we currently enjoy and provides an astute forecast for successfully stewarding pioneering tech entrepreneurship in the coming decades.I only had a very strict 45 minute window with Steve, so this is a pretty tightly focused discussion. It’s a conversation about the internet’s incipient Third Wave and the focus on partnerships, policy and persistence that will be required to tackle and transform hulking, real world sectors like health, transportation, education, energy, and food.It’s about something Steve calls impact investing — fostering the nascent emergence of entrepreneurship in outlier locales beyond the typical tech hotbeds of Silicon Valley, Silicon Alley and Silicon Beach.It’s a conversation about why the most valuable currency of the future is ideas.And it’s about why the killer app is, and will always be, people.Steve Case has impacted our world more than anyone I have ever met. It was an honor to converse with him, and I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

318,Dr. Melanie Joy,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/melanie-joy/,"Episode 240
July 31, 2016

“To identify with others is to see something of yourself in them and to see something of them in yourself — even if the only thing you identify with is the desire to be free from suffering.”Melanie JoyWhy do we love dogs, but eat cows?Cooking up your golden retriever would be an unthinkable abomination. But barbecued beef? That’s about as normal as it gets.It’s just the way things are. But why? The logic and social mechanisms behind why we eat some animals and not others is a behavioral inconsistency unexamined to the point of absurdity — both psychologically complex and strange — very strange indeed.Many guests on this podcast have elaborated on why we shouldn’t eat meat. This week I sit down with Melanie Joy, Ph.D, Ed.M to explain why we do eat meat.An idea she coined carnism, Dr. Joy’s work centers around the psychology of eating meat, what is known as the “meat paradox” – our irrational, inconsistent and species specific attitudes toward various animals – why we express affection towards certain animals while eating others – and the cognitive dissonance this entails.A Harvard-educated social psychologist, Dr. Joy is a celebrated speaker, organizational consultant, author of the award-winning book, Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows*, and eighth recipient of the Institute of Jainology’s Ahimsa Award, which was previously awarded to Nelson Mandela and the Dalai Lama. Her work has been featured by numerous national and international media outlets, including the BBC, NPR, and the New York Times. And she is the founder of the non-profit Beyond Carnism, which challenges dominant ideologies around food choice and systems and promotes a more mindful approach to our consumer choices.I came across Dr. Joy’s work via her popular TEDx Talk, Toward Rational, Authentic Food Choices — a very intelligent and cogent exploration of our normative cultural behaviors and attitudes around the food we eat and why — and have wanted to get her on the podcast ever since.I only had a tight hour with Dr. Joy, so this is a very focused discourse on speciesism and the psychological defense mechanisms we employ to rationalize our food choices. It’s a conversation about the psychology of social change, and it’s about how to employ psychologically optimal strategies in the advocacy of positive cultural change.Specific topics explored include:Whip smart, Dr. Joy peels back the fallacious facade of logic and exposes the denial that surrounds these cultural mores with keen intellect and grace. Irrespective of your dietary proclivities, my hope is that this provocative conversation will challenge assumptions and inspire you to make more informed consumer choices that more adeptly align with your core values as an empathetic and compassionate citizen.It was a pleasure to talk with Dr. Joy and I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

July 24, 2016

“[E]go is the enemy of what you want and of what you have: Of mastering a craft. Of real creative insight. Of working well with others. Of building loyalty and support. Of longevity. Of repeating and retaining your success. It repulses advantages and opportunities. It’s a magnet for enemies and errors. It is Scylla and Charybdis.”Ryan HolidayAsk today’s guest and he’ll tell you our culture is currently mired in an unprecedented epidemic of ego — a societal blight of apocalyptic proportions precipitated by the advent of selfie-crazed social media, self-esteem parenting and spurious self-help gurus fomenting an illusory sense of entitlement.The result is a woefully misplaced celebration of ubiquity over meaningfulness: Of endless distractions over devotion to work ethic. Of self-congratulatory passion over fidelity to process. Of unbridled hubris over humility. And of rampant self-seeking over service.We often equate ego with confidence, self-assuredness and ultimately success. The domain of the great visionary. But what if this notion is utterly false? A personality trait that, at every turn, thoroughly undermines that which we seek?And what if modesty, humility and self-honesty are not actual weaknesses but in fact our greatest asset?This week Ryan Holiday graces the podcast to explain.An autodidact of astute intellect that belies his 29 years, Ryan is many things — a voracious reader, prolific writer, shrewd observer of culture, media strategist and the author of four acclaimed bestselling books.Dropping out of college at 19, Ryan began his multi-faceted career as an apprentice under Robert Greene, the acclaimed author of The 48 Laws of Power*. He went on to amplify the work of several New York Times bestselling authors before serving as the director of marketing for American Apparel – a job he held at the ripe age of 22.When he’s not penning books or thought pieces for The Observer or Thought Catalog, Ryan oversees Brass Check— a consultancy firm he founded that advises New York Times bestselling authors like James Altucher, Arianna Huffington and even Tony Robbins, as well as corporate clients that include Google, Casey Neistat’s video sharing app Beme, Creative Live, Complex and Refinery 29.About a year ago, Ryan and I went deep on his life and his heralded book, The Obstacle Is The Way*— a primer on the functional applicability of stoic philosophy for turning modern-day obstacles into opportunities and adversity to advantage. Now translated into 17 languages, it’s a read that achieved cult status among some of the world’s most successful CEOs, political leaders, world class athletes and NFL coaches. One of my most popular episodes, I highly suggest you check out RRP 168 if you missed it the first time around.Today, Ryan drops in to talk about his new book, Ego Is The Enemy*. His best work to date, it’s a philosophical and historical exploration of the difficulties we unnecessarily create for ourselves throughout the various phases of life.If The Obstacle Is the Way is a roadmap for facing and overcoming external challenge, Ego Is The Enemy is a natural extension of that map, plotting practical strategies to optimally navigate our biggest internal limiter.This is a conversation about the menace of ego at every stage of life and career. How early in life, ego impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. How ego can blind us in success. How ego magnifies failure to hold us back. It’s a conversation about why we should be purposeful over passionate. And, to coin Ryan’s words, its about why we should be humble in our aspirations, gracious in our success and resilient in our failures.Specific topics discussed include:Intellectually curious, poised and self-effacing to a fault, Ryan is a rare breath of fresh air in a culture of bloviators and white noise. Plus, he’s a really good runner.

320,Griff Whalen,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/griff-whalen/,"Episode 238
July 17, 2016

“I get plenty of protein just from the plants that I’m eating, and I think there is a huge misconception about how much protein we actually need.”Griff WhalenWhat do you get when you combine Underdog with the spinach-chomping Popeye The Sailor Man?Griff Whalen.Currently serving up wide receiver and punt return duties for the Miami Dolphins, today’s guest is the only (to my knowledge) 100% plant-based athlete currently active in the National Football League.But Griff’s unique nutritional protocol is only a part of a larger, more compelling narrative. An inspirational tale of determination, tenacity and self-belief.The story begins with a scrappy kid from Ohio with an insane dream — to one day play professional football.But at 5’11” and 190 pounds, Griff doesn’t strike the typical NFL pose. He’s quiet, studious and understated in a culture of brash egos. Undersized on a field of gargantuan colossuses. Merely fast on a field of lightning-footed Greek gods.Griff, be serious. It’s just not going to happen.Although a standout high school player, the phone wasn’t exactly ringing off the hook with scholarship offers to the big NCAA Division I programs. Undeterred, Griff enrolls at Stanford and joins the squad as a non-scholarship walk-on.Expectations were low.Nonetheless, Griff persists. Flouting his God-given limitations, he out-trains his teammates and competitors. He studies the game like his life depends upon it. And, most interestingly, he plies his erudite, scholarly nature to the white space — overlooked aspects of mental, emotional and physical self-development to gain that extra edge to enhance his performance both on and off the field.It works. Defying the odds (a consistent theme with Griff), he makes the Stanford roster as one of only 8 true freshman to see action in 2008. Improving year by year, Griff closed out a very successful collegiate career as a starting wide receiver alongside storied quarterback Andrew Luck — his roommate and best friend to this day.The 2012 NFL Draft comes and goes. Griff’s phone doesn’t ring.But because luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity, he nonetheless gets picked up as an undrafted free agent by the Indianapolis Colts.The dream becomes reality.But before he can even celebrate his most implausible life-long goal finally realized — just four months after being signed, Griff breaks his foot and gets placed on injured reserve. A crushing setback that would end the career of most, Griff doubles down, using the off-time to his advantage.Understanding that his career depended upon him identifying every conceivable means to overcome his injury and talent deficit, he turns his attention to nutrition and begins to keenly study optimal methods to enhance his body’s ability to recover from exercise-induced stress. It’s an inquest that ultimately lead him to adopt a plant-based diet — a radical vegan experiment he now credits as central to bouncing back in 2013 — shredded, stronger and faster — to make the Colts’ starting lineup alongside long-time pal Andrew Luck, the NFL’s $140 million man.Currently in his 4th year with the NFL, today Griff finds himself heading into the 2016-17 season in a brand new city playing with a brand new team – the Miami Dolphins.Exploring the hows and whys of Griff’s plant-based protocol, a big part of today’s discussion centers on dispelling nutritional myths related to athletic performance. But at its core, this is a conversation about conviction and resilience. It’s about the importance of coaches and mentors. It’s about managing time and setting goals. It’s about refusing to give up. It’s about going the extra mile to find that that performance edge.And above all, it’s about the critical significance of believing in yourself.We cover a lot of ground in this conversation, including:I sincerely hope you enjoy this ball-toss with my favorite NFL athlete.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

321,Anthony Ervin,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/anthony-ervin/,"Episode 237
July 10, 2016

“I’ve always felt the story of my life has been about being normal but on the fringes of abnormality, and it’s the fringes that separate my history from the rest.”Anthony ErvinImagine winning an Olympic gold medal in swimming at age 19 at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. A feat never-before achieved by a swimmer of African-American descent, the frenzied media swarms. The only problem? You’re only half-black. You definitely don’t look black. And you know nothing about what it’s like to be part of the black experience.The unrelenting crush of public expectation to fulfill a role at odds with your private sense of self becomes so intense, you retreat from your Olympic experience not with any lasting sense of happiness, satisfaction and pride, but rather a numb confusion.This isn’t anything like I thought it would be…Over time, the confusion metastasizes into disillusionment. And it’s not long before depression sets in.Lost and lacking the tools to cope, life begins to pivot away from the dreaded black line at the bottom of the pool and towards a dreadlocked blur of rock ‘n roll, boozy, drug-fueled binges, rampant womanizing, cigarette haze, and death-defying motorcycle crashes.Nonetheless, over the next three years you continue to do the one thing you know how to do: swim. Not only do you continue to win, in 2001 you’re crowned the world champion in two events. But these results only magnify what is quickly becoming a profound crisis of identity.Who am I? Why am I doing this? What does it all mean?The answers continue to elude you until you find yourself so despondent, so desperate for relief, that you down a handful of tranquilizers. But the suicide attempt fails, fueling a sense of invincibility that only hastens the onset of an even more profound darkness.So, at the young age of 22, at the peak of his abilities, Anthony Ervin does what he has to — he walks away from the thing he used to love. The thing that gave him everything. The thing that made him a star. The thing that betrayed it’s promise of making him whole.In a Hail Mary attempt to discover and re-create his life, Anthony travels the world. He meditates at a Buddhist temple. He studies philosophy with a Sufi mystic. He reclaims his body with tattoos. He enrolls in graduate school but spends summers in Brooklyn, where he immerses himself in books, writes poetry, and even occasionally cross-dresses at parties.The denouement? Hawking his Olympic gold medal on eBay and donating the proceeds to the UNICEF tsunami relief fund.The only thing Anthony Ervin  didn’t do during this time? Swim.Not one stroke.*  *  *The next eight years marked a complete divorce from anything and everything swimming. In fact, not one of Anthony’s new friends during this time had any idea he was even an athlete, let alone an Olympic champion. He was just another tattooed, guitar-playing Brooklynite seeking answers to the Universe in music, meditation, books and partying.But with funds dwindling, Anthony offhandedly takes a gig teaching New York kids how to swim. The experience of service begins to erode his jaded shell and ignites an unexpected spark of appreciation for his former life. A new sense of self worth begins to emerge, informing the why in Anthony’s quest for spiritual self-actualization. Suddenly, love for the sport he so thoroughly placed in his rearview begins to rekindle.In 2011, Anthony returns to the water. And almost overnight, the impossible occurs.Twelve years after Sydney, Anthony qualifies for the 2012 London Olympics — his second U.S. Olympic team. Despite his 31 years of age (ancient in the world of swimming), Anthony swims faster than he did at the 2000 Trials.The amazing story doesn’t end there. This week finds Anthony in Rio, captaining Team USA in his third Olympiad at 35, the oldest U.S. male individual Olympic swimmer since 1904.Earlier this week he won gold on the men’s 4×100 freestyle relay, becoming the rare athlete to celebrate Olympic victories separated by 16 years. Friday evening, Anthony will ascend the starting blocks on the world’s largest stage to vie for the title of fastest swimmer on earth in the 50-meter freestyle — the crown jewel of swimming.UPDATE 8.12.16, 7:44pm: Sixteen years after his victory in Sydney, this evening Anthony claimed Rio gold in the 50-meter freestyle by a margin of .01 seconds, solidifying his place in sports history by becoming the oldest individual swimming gold medalist in Olympic history.The sheer implausibility of this astounding journey cannot be overstated.Competitive swimming at the elite level does not tolerate those who fail to pledge allegiance 365 days out of every year, year after year. Take six months off and you’re unlikely to ever return to form. But a decade? It’s not just unprecedented.It’s impossible.*  *  *The story of Anthony Ervin is awe-inspiring. A testament to his monumental talent, of course. He will go down in history as one of the most decorated and accomplished sprinters of all time, as well as one of the most interesting, dynamic and complicated athletes in Olympic history.But most compelling is the spiritual and emotional journey faced and weathered to rebuild the child into not only a champion for the ages, but a man.This journey — save the astounding developments of the last several months — is beautifully chronicled in Anthony’s recently released memoir, Chasing Water: Elegy of an Olympian*. Wholly original, it’s completely unlike any sports memoir you have previously read. Featuring arresting black-and-white drawings and a graphic story extra as well as an inventive and mercurial narrative style that morphs chapter by chapter to reflect Ervin’s restless, multifaceted life, it’s an uncommon, must read sui generis sports autobiography.At it’s core, this is a conversation about duality. It’s about identity, both public and private. It’s about rebellion versus conformity. Balance versus exceptionalism. Self-preservation versus self-destruction. Ego versus humility. Obligation versus actualization. Attachment versus surrender.It’s about heritage, race, priorities, expectations and super compensation.And it’s about what is truly important in life.Enjoy my conversation with one of the most talented, unique and complex Olympic athletes currently vying for gold in Rio.I hope you enjoy the exchange. And when the Rio dust settles, I promise to have him back to recap the experience and complete the circle.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

322,Andrew Morgan,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/andrew-morgan/,"Episode 236
July 3, 2016

“We have the ability to be a part of the kind of world we want to have or to be part of the destruction that we say we’re against.”Andrew MorganWhen I was a kid, shopping for new clothes was a treat. A special, infrequent occasion. Why? because even inexpensive garments challenged our middle-class family budget. By comparison, the mega-conglomerate retailers of today — Target, H&M, Gap, fill in the blank — allow the average, penny-pinching consumer to fill a closet for a $100 or less.How and when did clothing become an essentially disposable product? What exactly is going on?The answers to these questions will shock you.Andrew Morgan is the young, talented filmmaker behind the beautiful and heartbreaking documentary The True Cost. Premiering at last year’s Cannes Film Festival, it’s a movie about the untold story of fashion. It’s about the clothes we wear, the people who make them, and the impact the garment industry is having on the world we share.The film centers around the human rights and environmental implications of fast fashion — a term used to describe the increasingly rapid pace at which fashion houses push new trends at deflated prices made possible by global market ascendency and the comprehensive export of almost all manufacturing to the developing world. As a result, designer lines and trends once seasonal now move from factory to store shelves in a matter of mere weeks at a fraction of historical prices.It goes like this: prime the latent pump of consumer desire with hypnotic marketing campaigns featuring lithe models draped in the latest and greatist. Throw kerosene on the addictive must-have impulse with impossibly low prices. Obscure production transparency by shipping manufacturing to a far corner of the world. Then, before anyone discovers the product’s troubling genesis and poor quality, light a match, sit back and watch the shopping frenzy ensue. Repeat to the tune of $3 trillion annually.There’s only one problem — cheap is actually expensive. Because we’re ignoring the true cost.Any accurate accounting of fast fashion must include the priceless expense of systemic and severe worker exploitation rife across the developing world. It must take into consideration the incalculable environmental damage caused by its very processes of manufacturing. And it must contemplate the mistreatment and slaughter of billions of animals.Without a doubt, fast fashion is an extremely expensive, unmitigated free market failure. But Andrew isn’t interested in the good-guy-bad-guy narrative. He sees no purpose in shaming anyone nor pointing fingers.Andrew’s wish for us is simple: Ask better questions. Demand better solutions.Do I really need this? Who made this and how? What exactly went into this getting from wherever to here? In other words, what is the true cost of our daily and often subconsciously or unconsciously motivated consumer choices?I was quite impacted by Andrew’s stirring film; moved by this wise and thoughtful young man’s commitment to positively impacting the world. As such, it is my honor to share his important message with you today.This is a conversation about the inextricable connectivity that unites us all. It’s about our collective responsibility to be informed and to act. It’s about conscious capitalism over mindless consumption. And it’s about how every single day, every single one of us can make a tangible, positive difference in the world.Because in the words of Andrew, the greatest lie of all is that you can’t contribute.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

323,Colin O'Brady,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/colin-obrady-2/,"Episode 235
June 26, 2016

“It’s about the ability to know yourself — to know your own personal limits and be inspired to push beyond those limits.”Colin O’BradyIn documented history, only 44 people have successfully completed the extraordinary feat of adventure athleticism known as the Explorers Grand Slam — a challenge that encompasses scaling the highest mountain on each of the seven continents and treks to both the North and South Poles. Of these 44, only 2 have done it under a year.Not only is today’s guest the youngest person to conquer this most prestigious undertaking, Colin O’Brady absolutely smashed the world record by an incredible 53-day margin, completing the EGS in a mere 139 days. Along the way, he simultaneously broke the 7 Summits world record by two days.A Yale grad turned professional triathlete and Olympic hopeful, Colin is one very impressive young man. But perhaps more admirable than his mind boggling achievements is Colin’s commitment to service by way of his non-profit organization Beyond 7/2 – a directed mission to combat childhood obesity by raising $1 million on behalf of the Alliance For A Healthier Generation, a non-profit founded by the American Heart Association and the Clinton Foundation dedicated to helping kids to develop healthy habits.If you are relatively new to the podcast, it’s worth noting that Colin and I sat down this past December on the eve of his world record attempt. In case you missed it, RRP 207 is great conversation about his unique upbringing on a commune, his experiences swimming for Yale, how he survived an almost lethal burn accident that left him unlikely to walk again, his phoenix like transformation into a professional ITU triathlete and Olympic hopeful, and how he morphed into a mountaineer with the audacity to attempt such an incomprehensible feat of adventure athleticism.Picking up where we left off, this conversation recounts the highs and lows of Colin’s extraordinary accomplishment. It’s a conversation about the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual fortitude required to push beyond the ceiling of perceived ability. It’s a conversation about facing and overcoming obstacles. It’s about life and death decisions. Risk. Limits. Fear. It’s about the indomitable nature of the human spirit to overcome and persevere. And its about the importance of giving back.Specific topics include:It was an honor to spend a couple hours with this extraordinary human. My hope is that this conversation will help you question your own internal limiters and confront you with the very real truth that we are all capable of so much more than we allow ourselves to believe.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Nothing changes if nothing changes.”UnknownWe’re back with what I like to call a mini-sode.Last week I posted a long-awaited installment of Ask Me Anything — RRP 232. That episode is about an hour in length, but the last several minutes were pretty great — pure gold.I realize not everyone has time to digest all the content I produce. So, in case you skipped it or didn’t make it to the end — and because I didn’t want you to miss the best part — I thought I’d make it easy by excerpting the most impactful 7 minutes out of that conversation and repurposing it here as a brief mini-sode experiment.It’s all about waking up, getting real and taking responsibility for your path, growth and evolution.

Take a 30-minute drive south from Dublin to Greystones, a picturesque seaside town nestled along the Irish coast and you’ll stumble upon an impossible-to-miss family run natural food store overflowing with local, organic and seasonal produce. It’s also two whole food cafés as well as evening restaurant, where the brothers conduct wildly popular health education courses for the community.But venture beyond the welcoming Happy Pear storefront and you’ll quickly discover this isn’t just a veg shop — it’s an empire in the making. A vast and growing enterprise that encompasses a superfood sprout farm and a 14,000 sq. ft. facility aptly called Pearville where the twins’ team of 100 craft and distribute a prodigious line of organic, locally harvested plant-based products like granola, jam, hummus, pesto, fair trade coffees, smoothies, sprouted foods and even kombucha. To put it in perspective, I believe they are currently shipping about 30,000 healthy superfood bars a month.Relentless, selfless servants at the very center of Ireland’s healthy living movement, David & Stephen have synergistically authored two incredible cookbooks – The Happy Pear* (of course) and the recently released World of the Happy Pear*, which is already a runaway, smash bestseller across Ireland the UK. And when the super fit dads aren’t making pre-school breakfast picnics on the beach, engaging in impromptu handstand competitions, traveling extensively for public speaking or serving up kitchen duties on Jamie Oliver’s Family Food Tube (the largest foodie community in Europe), they enthusiastically guide a vast and devoted audience of wellness warriors across every social media platform from YouTube to Instagram to Snapchat with an endless stream of highly entertaining, quality nutrition and fitness tips, recipes, and daily slice-of-life vlogs with inspiration for miles.After our Italy retreat, Julie, Trapper & I spent an amazing few days with these boys. We got a spirited peek into their lives and advocacy. I even gave an evening talk at the restaurant, followed by an impromptu 5 am plunge in the chilly Irish Sea that drew over 100 keen participants (many of whom drove hours to attend), which speaks volumes about the brothers’ appeal and popularity.Not only are the inseparable David and Stephen Flynn positively the most charismatic and enthusiastic advocates for healthy living I have ever met, they are two guys who have cultivated incredible community and positivity and excitement around their powerful ideas related to living a healthy happy life.So what is The Happy Pear? The Happy Pear is David & Stephen. It’s everything they do and are. But fundamentally, The Happy Pear is a movement. A movement rooted in family and community with one singular goal — to make healthy food and lifestyle mainstream.So put on your seatbelt and lets go for a ride with David & Stephen. I sincerely hope you enjoy what I think is an incredible exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

327,Wim Hof,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/the-iceman-wim-hof/,"Episode 231
June 12, 2016

“I do not fear death, I fear not to live fully.”Wim “The Iceman” HofToday’s guest will challenge everything you thought you knew about human potential and leave you with one indelible, ineradicable truth:We are all sitting atop vast reservoirs of untapped, almost superhuman capabilities.Meet Wim Hof, aka The Iceman.A Dutch-born world record holder, adventurer, daredevil and human guinea pig, The Iceman is best known for his preternatural ability to withstand extreme cold. Perhaps more significant and compelling is his experimentation and experience with specific and teachable breathing techniques. Rooted in the ancient yogic tradition of pranayama and canonized for a modern audience as The Wim Hof Method, Wim asserts that he can “turn his own thermostat up” and consciously activate his sympathetic nervous system by using his mind through yoga.This may sound far-fetched. But get a grip on some of the crazy things this holder of more than 20 world records has accomplished:But there’s more.Under doctor supervision, In 2011 Wim voluntarily allowed himself to be injected with a poisonous E. coli endotoxin certain to make any human being very ill. The idea was to demonstrate that by using his meditation and breathing techniques he could effectively control his autonomic immune system response and nullify any deleterious health implications.Wim did not get sick.Beyond his countless feats of incredulity, he’s a long-time vegetarian who — for the last 30+ years — has refrained from eating any food before 6pm.All of this is seemingly insane. But Wim is hardly a carnival sideshow act — the physical stunts merely a means of attracting scientific community attention for purposes of study and documentation.Ask Wim and he will tell you that he is nothing special. He declares his feats replicable and his methods teachable — a curriculum that holds the potential to unlock a battery of human superpowers that extend well beyond extreme temperature tolerance to include control over a wide array of sympathetic nervous system and metabolic ‘reptilian brain’ functions previously thought to be beyond conscious manipulation.Case in point? After a mere 4 days of instruction, Wim led a group of brave, volunteering students through his endotoxin exposure experiment (again, under doctor supervision and scientific observation). Not one of them got sick. And he now routinely takes groups of students – most of which you would characterize as non-athletes — up Kilamanjaro. In nothing but shorts of course.An absolutely fascinating guy with charm and charisma for miles, my conversation with Wim is less about human biology than it is about belief systems. It’s an exploration of dormant biological and mental potential. It’s about yoga, grief, depression, change and the nature of consciousness. And it’s about the ever expanding event horizon of human potential that should push and challenge and nudge you out of your comfort zone to call into question the unnecessary limits we self-impose upon ourselves daily.Specific topics explored include:Finally, a warning from Wim: Never practice breathing exercises before/during any activities where a loss of consciousness may prove life threatening. The breathing methods discussed may have a profound effect and should be practiced exactly as explained and always in a safe environment. Wim strongly advises you to gradually build up your exposure to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If not practiced responsibly, you risk hypothermia or worse. And finally, always consult your doctor first before beginning any exercise program.With that out of the way, take a deep breath and prepare for the one of the most compelling and unique conversations I’ve ever had.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

June 5, 2016

“I so believe in unchecking all the boxes and then creating your own or just living in that fluid space where you’re redefining yourself everyday.”Robin ArzónIt’s not that powerful female role models don’t exist. They do. They’re everywhere.We just don’t do a good enough job celebrating them.So this week, I’m pleased to shine a bright spotlight on one of my favorite examples of female self-empowerment.Meet Robin Arzón.At the height of her corporate law career, Robin fearlessly left it all behind to embark on new adventures in the health and wellness space. She soon discovered her passion for coaching athletes, bridge running New York City, tackling ultra-marathons (she just completed her first 100-mile run and once ran five marathons in five days across Utah) and hosting wildly popular indoor cycling experiences that bear more resemblance to after-party raves than your typical spin class.But it’s not what she does that makes Robin special. It’s who she is.There was the time she was kidnapped and held at gunpoint. Then there’s the recent Type 1 diabetes diagnosis that persistently threatens to sideline her active lifestyle. But Robin isn’t interested in playing the victim. She’s interested in telling a different story. A story writ large that involves constant reinvention and tenacious commitment to personal growth. A narrative that aims to redefine, reform, and rethink possibility through movement.Human performance art in motion, Robin is a powerhouse of positive vibes. Confident, colorful and courageous with a no bullshit attitude and NYC street cred for days, she is inspiration personified. And she’s got a message for you:sweat transforms lives.Now Robin can add author to her resume, because her incredible new book Shut Up and Run: How to Get Up, Lace Up and Sweat with Swagger* hits bookstores everywhere June 21.Exploding with color, attitude and practical advice, Shut Up and Run is the ultimate embodiment of everything Robin. Equal parts fitness manual, self-help empowerment and coffee table photography book, it perfectly captures Robin’s ethos and aesthetic. Overflowing with tips, tricks, and most notably her welcome inviting hand, Shut Up and Run is an utterly unique breath of fresh air in a world of drab running manuals. A book screaming with attitude that beckons you to join her.I love Robin. She’s just an awesome person. And I really love her new book. So I was delighted to sit down with her once again and delve deeper into her fascinating life. Subjects explored include:If you are a long-time listener, then you remember well her previous powerhouse appearances on the show —  How To Undo Ordinary (RRP 99) & Do Epic Sh*t (RRP 137). If you happened to miss these conversations, I highly suggest checking them out.I think you’re going to like this one.

May 29, 2016

“It’s so much bigger than whether or not you want to eat a bag of potato chips; it’s really about our world and the future of our environment.”Zoe Lister-JonesYou’ve probably heard of GMOs. You might even have an opinion on the subject of genetically modified food. But I think it’s fair to say most of us are woefully under-informed when it comes to truly understanding and fully appreciating the vast extent to which this rapidly evolving science impacts all of us on a daily basis.54% of all Americans polled know little to nothing about GMOs despite the fact that 80% of all processed foods currently contain GMO.Those statistics shock me. Even worse? To date there exists no long-term studies on the impact of GMO on human and environmental health.I’m no expert on the issue. But I do know we need to talk more about GMO. Because they were so great on their first appearance on the podcast ( RRP 191 ), I invited Daryl Wein & Zoe Lister-Jones to return to the show to bring us up to speed on the latest scientific and political developments in this incredibly important and rapidly evolving world.In case you missed our first conversation, Daryl and Zoe are the filmmaking dynamic duo behind Consumed, a dramatic thriller in the vein of Erin Brockovich and Traffic set in the incendiary world of genetically engineered food. You may also know Zoe from her prime time CBS comedy sit com Life In Pieces or her appearance in Confirmation, the new HBO drama about the Anita Hill scandal.Daryl and Zoe are not scientists and they don’t play ones on film or television. They are artists. That said, they are passionate and incredibly informed when it comes to the broader, long-term implications of toying with the genetic material that forms our biosphere.Few issues are as delicate, controversial or emotionally charged as GMO. It takes courage to tackle the subject on film. I applaud that.Today we pick up where RRP 191 left off and get granular, diving much deeper into what in my opinion qualifies as one of the most important subjects of our time. Specific topics explored include:Also, Consumed was just released on demand. It’s available in certain territories on iTunes, Amazon and Google Play, but the best place to find it, stream it, download it, watch it and learn more is consumedthemovie.com.The film is really well done — impactful, earnest, thoughtful and entertaining. But it’s not a documentary. It doesn’t presuppose to answer questions, only ask them.As for questions, I’ve got a few of my own. So let’s get to the asking.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“All the instructions have been written for everybody on the planet. I just didn’t find an instruction book until I almost died.”Chris DavisThis week we shift gears.I admit it. Having famous celebrity guests on the podcast is fun. If you had told me three years ago that people like Moby, Arianna Huffington and Russell Simmons would actually reach out to me to sit down for a long conversation, I would have said you were insane.More gratifying is introducing you to important people from my personal life. Anonymous and relatable everyday men and women who also happen to be extraordinary.I believe these people form the heart and soul of the RRP. It’s what truly distinguishes this show from the others.Chris Davis is one of those guys.He isn’t famous. He hasn’t written a book. He’s just a guy. A husband, father and worker among workers doing his best to navigate this messy labyrinth we call life just like the rest of us.But dig deeper and you’ll find an extraordinary man with an astonishing story.Because Chris Davis should be dead.From alcohol-fueled blackouts in Germany to crack-induced psychosis in Long Beach, Chris Davis was a lost cause drug addict / alcoholic on a crash course with jails, institutions and ultimately death. Miraculously, he recovered from what by all accounts was a hopeless and incomprehensible state of desperation and demoralization.His reward? A beautiful life. A family. The gift of helping countless achieve and maintain sobriety.Then liver cancer.The prognosis? 14 months. Get your affairs in order.But Chris had his own plan.This is a story about survival. It’s about the insanity of addiction and the miraculous mysteries of sobriety. It’s about human will, courage, faith and surrender.The story of Chris Davis is a hero’s journey worthy of Joseph Campbell himself.It’s a privilege to have this man in my life. It’s a privilege to call him friend. And it’s a privilege to share his story with you today.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

331,Steve-O (+His Dad!),https://www.richroll.com/podcast/steve-o/,"Episode 227
May 15, 2016

“I think the way we treat others is a pretty pure reflection of how we feel about ourselves.”Steve-OHe’s set his head on fire, backflipped off buildings, snorted wasabi and leaped off a bridge from a moving car. He even stuck a fish hook through his cheek and put fireworks where they should never go. Don’t get me started on what he’s done with a stapler.Ever since he snatched a video camera from his father’s closet at age 15, Steve-O has lived for attention. And the Jackass star learned early and often that public adulation escalated in lock step with the outrageousness of his behavior.The equation was simple: the further he pushed the envelope, the more America’s favorite prankster felt loved and alive.Insanity ensues.Still, it wasn’t enough. It would never be enough. An insatiable hunger for wholeness that could never be sated. A spiritual hole he almost died trying to fill — first through external validation, then through substances. As insanely dangerous as his stunts had become, it was drugs and alcohol that ultimately brought Steve to his knees. To the brink of death. To the psych ward. To sobriety.It was March of 2008. A moment that broke him. A moment that saved him.Let’s back up.Steve-O knows how to play the idiot.But Stephen Glover is no moron.Growing up in five countries fluently speaking three languages, Steve has maintained household name status for almost two decades in an industry famous for it’s flash in the pans and also rans. He’s starred in a variety of television shows and movies, including (of course) three global blockbuster installments of Jackass. Sober since 2008, he wrote the New York Times bestselling memoir Professional Idiot*, then reinvented himself as a successful stand-up comedian. On the heels of his recently released Showtime special Guilty As Charged, Steve has taken his unique blend of comedy, stunts, stories and performance art on the road, selling out venues across across the globe.I’ve known Steve for over seven years. When the camera is off, he’s far more grounded than you might imagine. Surprisingly self-aware, present, generous and contemplative are just a few descriptors that spring to mind.That’s the Steve I’m interested in.So this week we go beyond Steve-O to meet Stephen Glover — the human being behind the clown, comedian, stunt man and provocateur.The best part? We’re joined by Steve’s dad. Not only was this Ted Glover’s first podcast, I believe it’s the first time Steve and Ted have ever been interviewed together (at least on audio).The result is glorious.This is a conversation about health, environmentalism and ethics. It’s about the damage inflicted by addiction on loved ones. It’s about recovery, forgiveness and spiritual evolution. It’s about what used to drive Steve and what drives him now.But most of all it’s about the love between a father and son.This one’s special.

“The stuff that really delivers happiness is available to almost everybody and most of it is free or not very expensive—it’s the meaning we bring to it.”MobyMost know Moby as the eclectic and introspective DJ / musician behind Play — an album that sold over 12 million copies and elevated dance electronica from the clubs of lower Manhattan into a full-blown mainstream phenomenon.Far more interesting is the story of Moby himself.Reared in suburban poverty by a single mom, Moby was an awkward, alienated kid who turned early and often to music for comfort. Classical guitar and music theory morphed into high school punk efforts like the Vatican Commandoes and post college dropout stints DJ’ing at local Connecticut nightclubs. But traction eluded him.So in 1989, this poor, white, skinny, Christian, vegan teetotaler pilgrimaged south to lower Manhattan, thrusting his frail, wide-eyed self into the beautiful, hedonistic, harrowing life of art, music & impoverished squalor that defined the drug-fueled dance music scene of downtown New York City in the 1990’s.Cribbing from the flap copy of Porcelain*, Moby’s arresting, magnificent new memoir hitting bookstores next week, “[h]e would learn what it was to be spat on, to live on almost nothing. But it was perhaps the last good time for an artist to live on nothing in New York City: the age of AIDS and crack but also of a defiantly festive cultural underworld. Not without drama, he found his way. But success was not uncomplicated; it led to wretched, if in hindsight sometimes hilarious, excess and proved all too fleeting. And so by the end of the decade, Moby contemplated an end in his career and elsewhere in his life, and put that emotion into what he assumed would be his swan song, his good-bye to all that, the album that would in fact be the beginning of an astonishing new phase: the multimillion-selling Play.”Not only was Play a multi-platinum smash success, it would soon become the soundtrack to our lives — a record that would shift culture and cement Moby as one of the most interesting and iconic musicians of our time.Wealth and fame arrived. Obsession followed. And Moby embraced it all. Mansions, lofts and country manors. Debauchery, blowouts and binges. Whatever, whenever. Anytime, all the time. It was always too much. It was never enough.And this is where things get really interesting.The story of Moby is one of fidelity to authenticity. It’s about a life defined by survival, perseverance and self-belief. It’s about losing one’s self to surrender to the higher self within. It’s about discovering what is most important in life. And the beautiful trudge towards clarity, purpose, satisfaction and service.Today we explore the remarkable life of a most extraordinary artist — a man as introspective as he is self-deprecating; and as serious as he is deadpan droll.I absolutely love this exchange. So press Play and enjoy.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

“There’s always opportunity in the midst of everything, but most people are so focused on blaming someone else for why it’s not working they don’t see the opportunity.”Jack CanfieldWho am I to disagree with a guy who has sold 500 million books?That is not hyperbole.Not only has Jack Canfield — the personal growth & self-improvement author behind The Success Principles* and the wildly popular Chicken Soup For The Soul* series — actually sold that many copies of his many books, a full 47 of them have graced the New York Times bestseller list. In fact, Jack holds a Guinness World Record for having 7 books on the NYT list at the same time.I don’t know how that’s even possible. I do know he’s recently pulled focus on alcoholism, tackling addiction in his most recent offering, The 30-Day Sobriety Solution: How to Cut Back or Quit Drinking in the Privacy of Your Own Home*.I almost backed out of doing this interview. You may think I’m a New Age California hippie, but I’m actually a relatively skeptical guy. I’m not easily romanced by the latest in self-help. I can be stubborn and my perspective on long-held beliefs can be difficult to shake.I’m also someone with extremely strong, experience-based opinions about sobriety — not only what’s required to achieve it,  but more importantly what’s essential to properly maintain it.To be frank, part of me feels it’s somewhat ostentatious for Jack — not himself a recovering alcoholic — to publish a book that purports to resolve alcoholism by virtue of a 30-day program. In my experience, sobriety just doesn’t work that way. Moreover, I’m far from convinced that you can successfully combat addiction from the privacy of your own home. Let me rephrase — I couldn’t do that. Thus my conscience struggles to ratify or validate an author who supports such a methodology.I’m a 12-step guy through and through – I can say without reservation or exaggeration that it saved my life. My participation and service in recovery is and remains my #1 priority. But as they say in the rooms, contempt prior to investigation keeps a man in everlasting ignorance. So in good faith, I read Jack’s new book with an open mind. I can’t say I agree with everything it proposes. But I can say it does contain more than a few valuable insights — more than enough to merit a spirited exchange with it’s acclaimed author.Moreover, I couldn’t resist the opportunity to tackle this conversation. It’s not everyday you get invited up to Santa Barbara to visit the home of a man revered for a life devoted to serving the personal growth of others.So needless to say, here we are. I haven’t listened to any other interviews with Jack, but I think its fair to say – and by Jack’s own admission — this conversation is not your normal fare.I’m not saying it was contentious (it wasn’t at all). Jack was a great sport and I think my dubiousness made for a fun and engaging meeting of the minds.Specific topics explored include:I’m really glad I went through with this one. I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Getting enough sleep doesn’t mean that you are giving up your goals or your desire to achieve and succeed—on the contrary, it makes you more effective…it’s a performance enhancer.”Arianna HuffingtonArianna Huffington is more productive than you are.In addition to co-founding The Huffington Post in 2005 (which famously sold to AOL in 2011 for $315 million), she has dominated television news for decades as a globally recognized political pundit; authored 15 books; built multiple profitable businesses; pioneered online journalism; and even ran for Governor of California as an independent in 2003.Under Arianna’s stewardship, in 2012 HuffPo won a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting, representing a seismic shift in journalism from traditional print prominence to online, cementing digital media’s permanence, force, and legitimacy. Not enough? Arianna has been named to the Time 100 list of most influential people and the Forbes Most Powerful Women list.So what’s her secret?The answer might surprise you:a great night of sleep.A devoted mom of two college-aged girls, Arianna learned the value of sleep the hard way. A burnout episode several years ago left her chronically exhausted, priming an exploration to redefine what it means to live well — beyond business and financial success. Her NY Times bestselling smash hit Thrive* established her authority on well-being and today she is pioneering a movement — make that a revolution — that debunks the false bravado and cultural, mythical pride associated with burning the midnight oil to instead champion sleep as the key to unlock maximum potential. The tip of Arianna’s latest campaign of insurrection is her new book, The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life One Night At A Time*.A couple weeks ago, I had the opportunity to sit down with Arianna at the LA Book Fair to learn more. Arriving replete with full entourage in tow, I admit to being a little intimidated. But with grace and presence, she quickly put me at ease.In a perfect world, I would have loved the time and bandwidth to delve deeply into Arianna’s upbringing, her political evolution from conservative to liberal, her authorship and her spiritual perspective on the important matters of life. However, I only had a tight hour, so this exchange is focused predominantly on sleep and provides a nice complement to my recent podcast, How To Sleep Smarter With Shawn Stevenson.Specific topics include:Arianna was absolutely delightful.

April 17, 2016

“Avoidance of bad food and interactions with shitty people is the key to happiness.”John JosephBack by popular demand, John Joseph — legendary New York hardcore punk icon and Cro-Mags’ frontman — returns for a 4th appearance on the RRP to do what he does best: incite, provoke, educate and entertain.If you’re a longtime listener of the show, Johnny Bloodclot needs no introduction — he’s my most popular guest to date.For the uninitiated, John is a true American original. The very definition of hardcore. A survivor. A spiritual warrior spouting straight talk directly from the streets of the Lower East Side with one singular, driving purpose:getting people to wake the f&*k up.Conceived and raised in abuse, deprived of opportunity and left to his own devices, John turned to violence and drugs to make his way in the world. It’s a path that predictably led to violence, crime, addiction and incarceration. His teen years spent as a drug mule, he graduated from foster care to unimaginably horrific stints in juvenile detention. Then things went downhill. To avoid long-term incarceration, he enlisted in the Navy, only to go AWOL after a fight.Fleeing the law and rudderless, John found redemption in the hardcore punk rock scene flourishing on Manhattan’s Lower East Side in the early 1980’s. Taken in by the Bad Brains’ frontman H.R. — a devotee of Rastafari — John began to explore not just his musicianship, but his spirituality as well.  It’s a journey that birthed the Cro-Mags— one of the era’s most iconic and influential hardcore punk bands —  and later led to life in a Hare Krishna monastery, where he found his spiritual salvation and developed a life-long love of meditation, yoga, the vegan lifestyle, racing Ironman triathlons, and most importantly, his profound devotion to service.This guys walks his talk.I urge the newcomer to check out John’s first appearance on the show. One of the most powerful podcasts I have ever published, RRP 41 is a beautiful documentation of an incredible life. When you’re done with that, dial up RRP 66 & RRP 95. Then turn your attention to Meat Is For Pussies*. I’m proud of the foreword I wrote for John’s book and it’s a fun, easy read — especially for the skeptical male who continues to harbor the misinformed idea that giving up animal products equates to an abandonment of masculine identity.Today’s conversation picks up where we last left off. Specific topics include:This October, John is headed to Kona — racing the Ironman World Championships to raise funds and awareness for the Children’s Tumor Foundation and in particular, his young friend “Alexander The Great” Owens, who suffers from neurofibromatosis. To get involved, contribute to his fundraising campaign HERE; run with him in the Cro-Mags’ NYHC 10K & 5K Tumor Stomp  in NYC on May 4; or see him play at the F*ck Tumors Hardcore Benefit on May 29 at NYC’s Highline Ballroom.I’m proud to call John one of my closest friends and I sincerely hope you enjoy this special exchange.LANGUAGE ADVISORY: John drops more f-bombs in this conversation than I could count.

April 10, 2016

“I found that I was being betrayed by the food industry…and it was only as I started to pull that apart and what that meant did I realize all of the ways I had also been betraying myself.”Jasmin SingerThe facts of our experiences are different. But so many of the emotions we experience along our journeys are remarkably similar.Meet Jasmin Singer.As a kid, Jasmin was an outcast. Fat and persistently bullied, she was hopelessly drawn to foods that only fueled the depression and confused disposition incited by her chaotic upbringing.Encouraged by her gorgeous mother to trade in her Oreos for pre-packaged Weight Watchers brownies resulted in an endless rotation of Nutri-System appointments and Jenny Craig weigh-ins that ultimately did little to rectify her love of cheddar, resolve her body image issues or soothe the pain of childhood trauma.The grub always won. Because food offered Jasmin something she found nowhere else. She basked in the safe reassurance of mealtimes, in the calm friendship she shared with snacks. She lived for the sweet tingling of a vanilla shake as it slid down her throat, filling up her stomach and, more importantly, her heart.This is a long way of saying that Jasmin was, in fact, addicted to food – physically and emotionally. And no wonder. The foods she regularly ate growing up – Cheez-Its, Lunchables, Twinkies, Big Macs – were literally designed to activate the pleasure centers in her brain, making her want more and more and more.A growing awareness of the horrors of industrialized animal agriculture led to Jasmin’s emerging sense of just how profoundly her culinary proclivities had betrayed her. So at 19, she became a vegetarian. Later, she went entirely vegan, stepping into a lifelong passion for animal rights advocacy. Nonetheless, the skinny vegan trope eluded her. Instead, she continued to gain weight due to her continuing love affair with greasy rich foods.Just because it’s vegan doesn’t mean it’s healthy.In the firm grips of her hopeless addiction, Jamin became resigned to the deep sense of shame that accompanied her every minute of every day, further isolating her in a bottomless pit of desperation and loneliness that drove an isolating wedge between her and the world.From the extra pounds and unrelenting bullies that left her eating lunch alone in a bathroom stall at school to the low self-esteem that rendered her physically and emotionally vulnerable to abuse, her struggle with weight came to define every aspect of her life.And then one day, she decided to make a change…By committing to monthly juice fasts and a plant-based diet comprised of whole, unprocessed foods, Jasmin lost almost a hundred pounds, gained an understanding of her destructive relationship with food, and finally realized what it means to be truly full.Today, Jasmin is the co-founder and executive director of Our Hen House, a nonprofit multimedia hub working to change the world for animals. She also serves up co-host duties on the popular Our Hen House Podcast, produces an online magazine and video content and travels extensively to publicly speak on the subjects of veganism and social justice.As laid bare in her brave and intensely vivid coming-of-age memoir, Always Too Much And Never Enough*, it’s a story you might be surprised to learn really isn’t about weight loss. Rather, it’s about one person’s quest to find peace with one’s self. From feeding her emotions to feeding her soul, it’s a journey to wholeness through embracing the idea that true health comes from abundance on your plate and in your life.This week, Jasmin shares her powerful story with laudatory honesty and vulnerability.Specific topics explored include:Special thanks to Jessica Mahady for graciously allowing me use of her photography in today’s podcast.I love Jasmin, respect her courage and sincerely hope you enjoy our exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

April 3, 2016

“I have a belief, still to this day, that everything you put in your mouth is a life or death decision.”Doug EvansWhen I was a kid, I loved The Jetsons. I was convinced that by 2000 life would be all jetpacks, flying cars, sky trams and robot housekeepers.My timeline was overly optimistic, but we’re nonetheless surrounded by evidence of this inevitability. From the advent of virtual reality to self-driving cars, drone delivery and beyond, even Elon Musk’s idea of colonizing Mars now seems plausible.This week ushered in the future of kitchen appliances. Meet Juicero— a complete re-imagination of cold press juice for the home and office that even George Jetson would envy. I know it sounds weird. It’s hard to explain. So I’m not going to try. Watch this cool video instead:Juicero is the brainchild of my friend Doug Evans. An idea so big it captured the hearts and minds of Silicon Valley, attracting $120 million in financing from technology’s most high-powered VC’s, including Kleiner Perkins and Google Ventures. I started hearing rumors about Doug and Juicero about a year ago. Then last month, Doug invited me to visit his 100,000 square foot Los Angeles distribution center. I was excited to finally see what all the fuss was about. But in all honesty, I was skeptical.$120 million for a new-fangled juice machine? I don’t get it.He gave me a tour. I met the team and tested the goods. Not only was it the best juice I had ever tasted, I realized there is much more going on at Juicero than meets the eye.A marvel of advanced technology, the future-forward wifi-enabled Juicero exerts 8,000 pounds of pressure to cold-press the freshest juice possible from QR-coded organic produce packs (soon to be 100% compostable) that contain detailed information on nutrition, the farm of origin and the date of harvest (never to exceed 5 days).None of the nutrient degrading pasteurization mandatory in all store bought juice. No more old or non-organic produce typical of most juice bars. And of course, zero home cleanup.The space-age functionality and highly complex machinery are housed in cutting edge design courtesy of legendary product designer Yves Béhar that expertly merges aesthetics with simplicity and user friendliness. Comparisons to Apple are inevitable. And rumor has it even Jony Ive had a behind-the-scenes hand in guiding Juicero’s product design.But the gadget is just part of the story.Perhaps more fascinating is the personal journey of Juicero’s steward, a most unlikely entrepreneur. A graffiti artist reared on the streets of New York City, Doug Evans traded the classroom for tagging subway trains and hanging out in clubs with the likes of Basquait, Warhol and Haring before finding his calling as a graphic artist under the mentorship of the great Paul Rand. A confluence of tragic events around Doug’s 30th birthday would permanently alter the trajectory of his life and career. In 1994, his mother died of cancer. Shortly thereafter, his father died of heart disease. Meanwhile, Doug’s brother developed type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and had the first of two strokes.Terrified by the prospect that he was genetically pre-disposed to early mortality, Doug turned to the raw vegan lifestyle, igniting a passion for the connection between lifestyle and health that boils down to one simple, yet powerful edict:fruits and vegetables save lives.That epiphany ignited an entrepreneurial spark that birthed Organic Avenue in the early 2000’s, New York’s first chain of organic cold-press juice shops. Doug provided the financing. Founder Denise Mari provided the juice.I’ve been friends with Doug for many years. A yogi and minimalist in his personal life, he lives in accordance with the principles of ahimsa, or no harm. He is utterly indefatigable. Maniacal about quality. And always focused on service.To me, Juicero is but a natural next step beyond Organic Avenue. An external manifestation of Doug’s dogged determination to continuously break conventional wisdom paradigms and persistently innovative new ways to promote maximum health and wellness through optimum nutrition.Last week I visited Doug in San Francisco at Juicero HQ. It was the day before product launch. Three years of cloak and dagger stealth mode was about to end. The world was on the precipice of finally meeting Juicero. Anticipation was running high. The excitement amongst the team was palpable and infectious. I felt privileged to be there, and grateful that Doug took time out on such an auspicious day to share his story with me.Today I share that story with you.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam. Just awesome.NOTE: I realize there is some online grousing about Juicero’s pricing ($699 for the unit, plus $4-$10 per produce pouch). I get it. At the moment, it’s an aspirational product for most. But I liken it to Tesla — don’t forget that Elon’s first offering was a supercar in a Lotus body. A car then out of reach for even most of the 1%. Then last week brought the unveiling of Tesla’s $35K Model 3 — a car I have no doubt will forever alter the auto industry landscape. So if you are one of the grousers, I suggest you give Juicero the benefit of the doubt. Doug is a remarkable guy and there is something truly special about this company and his team I have no doubt will ultimately impact mainstream culture in a positive and profound way. I’m a fan and I can’t wait to see where Doug takes it.Listen & Subscribe on  iTunes | Soundcloud | Stitcher Thanks to this week’s sponsors:Harrys.com: A superior shave at an affordable price. Type in my coupon code “ROLL” at purchase for $5 off your starter set and get an entire month’s worth of shaving for just $10 when you visit Harrys.com.

“I’m doing everything possible to make sure that chefs really see themselves as responsible for delivering not just taste, but health. Chefs can be drug-dealers—some of the food they’re putting out there is worse than drugs—or they can be healers.”Matthew KenneyHe’s written twelve cookbooks. He’s opened dozens of restaurants. And he’s teaching a new generation of culinary talent across the globe. But Matthew Kenney isn’t just another celebrity chef. Matthew Kenney is crafting the future of food.Beyond the kitchen, Matthew is a public speaker, educator, and entrepreneur specializing in plant-based food. He has authored 12 cookbooks and is the founder of Matthew Kenney Cuisine, an integrated lifestyle company as well as the Matthew Kenney Culinary Academy, a series of state-of-the-art education centers offering vegan culinary courses both online and in person that emphasize the use of whole, organic, unprocessed, plant-based foods to achieve healthy, aesthetically refined and flavorful cuisine.Over the years, Matthew has launched a panoply of eating establishments ranging from the hautest of haute cuisine to take-out casual — everything from Santa Monica’s M.A.K.E. and New York’s Pure Food & Wine (both now closed), to Plant Food & Wine in both Venice and Miami, Make Out in Culver City, California and the recently opened and utterly amazing 00 + Co. plant-based pizzeria in New York City’s East Village. When in Belfast, Maine visit The Gothic. Plant Café is coming to Bahrain this fall and Matthew has something brewing for summer in Montecito, California.It’s one thing to cook great food. It’s another thing to cook great plant-based food. But it’s astonishing to please the masses with incredibly delicious and nutritious plant-based meals without cooking anything at all. However, what most impresses me most about Matthew is not his culinary talent. It’s his commitment to changing the cultural conversation around food. And in turn, change the world.Today I sit down with Matthew in the wine room behind Plant Food & Wine Venice to get to the bottom of everything except the wine (don’t worry I didn’t drink any). Specific topics explored include:But at its core, this is a conversation about the future of food — and the incredible influence a high profile chef has on forging public opinion and taste when it comes to cuisine, culture and health.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

March 20, 2016

“A good night of sleep starts the moment you wake up in the morning.”Shawn StevensonYou cannot underestimate the value of an incredible night’s sleep.On the rare occasion I awake from 8 hours of dead to the world slumber, everything is better. I am more present, alert and productive. The quality of my interactions with family and friends is significantly enhanced. Colors are brighter. My mood is sunnier. And physically, I feel amazing. So I can’t help but wonder:what would my life be like if I could sleep that well every night?Intellectually, we all know sleep is super important. But most — including myself — fail to acknowledge just how crucial sleep is to every aspect of our daily lives. Traditionally, sleep is the first thing I compromise when I get busy.Sleep is for whimps!But I’ve completely changed my tune on this issue. As I age, achieving optimal sleep quality has become increasingly elusive. And I have become more attuned to the extent to which my day is negatively impacted by sub-optimal sleep. So I have recently committed to experimenting with a number of techniques and strategies (some obvious, some not) to improve what I now understand and appreciate is absolutely essential to living a balanced, healthy and optimally productive life.I’m happy to say it’s working.This is a long way of saying that I have been thinking alot about sleep lately. So I’m excited to share this conversation on the subject with sleep expert Shawn Stevenson. A wellness evangelist and host of the Model Health Show podcast, Shawn also recently authored Sleep Smarter: 21 Essential Strategies to Sleep Your Way to A Better Body, Better Health, and Bigger Success*.I had a great time on Shawn’s podcast about a year ago (click here to listen), so it was fun to explore his compelling personal journey with wellness and dive deep into the subject of sleep. Specific topics include:Shawn is a great guy with a velvety voice custom made for podcasting. But more importantly, this conversation is packed with practical advice, powerful tools and helpful information that will enhance your appreciation for sleep and just might impact your daily life experience profoundly.

March 13, 2016

“It’s interesting how the ocean can attract us, repel us, nourish us, and hurt us—I don’t think there’s anything else quite like it.”Adam SkolnickImagine plunging headfirst hundreds of feet below the ocean surface — undulating ever further downward to a place where light cannot penetrate; and life hangs in the balance of a quickly diminishing singular breath.Competitive freediving—a sport built on diving as deep as possible on a single breath—tests the limits of human ability in the most hostile environment on earth. The unique and eclectic breed of individuals who freedive at the highest level regularly reach such depths that their organs compress; and one mistake could kill them.To freedive is to flirt with death, driven by an almost inexplicable spiritual quest to go further, deeper and beyond the imagined limits of human capability.But freediving is also an opportunity to be free. It’s a search for the authentic. An opportunity to commune with the infinite.Today on the podcast I sit down with author and adventure journalist Adam Skolnick, who immersed himself in this extreme yet poetic subculture to tell the story of Nicholas Mevoli, America’s greatest freediver and the protagonist of Adam’s masterfully crafted new book, One Breath: Freediving, Death, and the Quest to Shatter Human Limits*.Even among freedivers, few have ever gone as deep as Mevoli. A handsome young American with an unmatched talent for the sport, Nick was among freediving’s brightest stars. He was also an extraordinary individual, one who rebelled against the vapid and commoditized society around him by relentlessly questing for something more meaningful and authentic, whatever the risks. So when Nick Mevoli arrived at Vertical Blue in 2013, the world’s premier freediving competition, he was widely expected to challenge records and continue his meteoric rise to stardom.Instead, before the end of that fateful competition Nick Mevoli had died, a victim of the sport that had made him a star.Traveling the world writing for The New York Times, Playboy, Outside, ESPN.com, BBC.com, Salon.com, Men’s Health, Wired, and Travel + Leisure, Adam was on site to cover Vertical Blue when he became a direct witness to Nick’s passing. His first-hand account landed on the front page of The New York Times, quickly went viral and set the stage for One Breath — a remarkably engaging exploration of Nick’s unforgettable story and the sport which shaped and ultimately destroyed him.In the vein of Into The Wild and Born To Run, One Breath is one of the best books I have read in a long time. And I read a lot of books.Today we unpack this mysterious subculture and the remarkable athleticism of its inhabitants. But at it’s core, this is a quite compelling conversation about passion. An examination of obsession, escapism, and the spiritual yearning for authenticity.I really love this one. So sit back, inhale one deep breath, and submerge yourself in the world of Adam Skolnick.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“You’ve got to know what you are good at — that’s the game. If I had a potion that could allow somebody to become fundamentally self-aware and know what they’re good at, they would all win.”Gary VaynerchukNobody works harder — and smarter — than Gary Vaynerchuk.That’s because the maniac known online as Gary Vee operates on one mode and one mode only: full blast. Gregarious, confident and incomparably charismatic, Gary is never at a loss for opinions on everything from the future of social media and the preeminent importance of authenticity to his almost antiquated but refreshing take on the importance, power and relevance of a committed work ethic – a welcome breath of fresh air that stands in stark contradiction to our pervasive, myopic lifehack culture — a regrettable, technocrat popular trend that woefully overvalues false promise short cuts to success over passion, service and fidelity to the journey.Internet omnipotent with over 1.2 million followers on Twitter, 500K+ Facebook friends and a vast and loyal YouTube subscriber base, I suspect many of you are already daily consumers of Gary’s persistent, relentless feed of videos, blog posts, social media updates, Snapchat stories and live casts.For those unfamiliar, Gary is a Belarus-born entrepreneur, venture capitalist and CEO of NYC-based VaynerMedia, one of the fastest growing digital ad & marketing agencies in the world.A mainstay on YouTube, Gary hosts the hugely popular #AskGaryVee Show and dons protagonist duties on #TheDailyVee, a surprisingly hypnotic, behind the scenes gander into Gary’s everyday business life.You’ve seen him profiled in the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, GQ, Time and Fortune’s annual list of 40 under 40. You’ve watched him on Late Night With Conan O’Brien and Ellen. And maybe you’ve even read one his three New York Times bestselling books,  Crush It*,  Jab, Jab, Jab*, Right Hook*,  The Thank You Economy* and now #AskGaryVee* – his newest offering which hits bookstores everywhere March 8. A compelling and entertaining distillation of practical, timeless workplace advice on entrepreneurship and management for anyone launching their own company, working in digital media, starting their first job or simply seeking inspiration, Gary’s fourth book is certain to be a massive, ubiquitous success.A legitimate marketing & business genius, Gary is a kick in the pants – loud, irreverent and unconventional. But he’s also incredibly warm, personable and quite giving when it comes to freely sharing a seemingly endless stream of good ideas, tools and strategies he credits as part and parcel of his personal success equation.Conversing with Gary is a bit like trying to wrangle a wild horse, so this one is a bit all over the place. But it’s also packed with copious gems to take your game next level. Specific topics covered include:Driven not by profit, but instead by gratitude, I find Gary’s energy infectious. Over the years, he has personally inspired my various entrepreneurial pursuits, so it was a thrill to finally pick his brain during my recent visit to his NYC VaynerMedia headquarters.So sit back, tap a vein and mainline the rush that is Gary Vee.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“I believe in the power of small wins—whatever you are looking to do, whether you are looking to improve your relationship, your diet, work—focus on little things, win, and move from there.”Jason WachobIntellectually, we all know that true happiness is not a function of material status. Nonetheless, we all catch ourselves repeating the mantra, if I only had X, then I would be happy.Nonsense. Not only can you be happy now, it’s your birthright. Because the good life isn’t about your bank account, it’s about your lifestyle. And lifestyle is a choice.This is the subject of my wellness entrepreneur friend Jason Wachob’s new book, Wellth: How I Learned To Build A Life, Not A Resumé*, which hits bookstores everywhere March 1. In addition to being a beautiful personal memoir, its about how to cultivate a lifestyle where happiness is attainable, health is paramount, work is purposeful, friendships are deep and plentiful, and daily living is about abundance and joy.But how? By redefining what it means to live successfully based upon the non-financial currency of wellbeing.As co-founder and CEO of MindBodyGreen.com, the internet’s biggest online destination for all things wellness, Jason is one of the movement’s most prominent, leading voices. But Jason himself was not always well. After a successful basketball career at Columbia University, he took his competitive spirit to Wall Street. Workaholism, stress and poor lifestyle habits rewarded his bank account and lionized his caricature on the walls of the famous Palm steakhouse. But happiness, personal satisfaction and well-being eluded him.Jason’s faced-paced, sedentary lifestyle led to chronic back pain every surgeon said could not be resolved short of surgery. Against medical advice, Jason instead began to explore yoga, which miraculously resolved his persistent, painful condition. Amazed by the body’s ability to heal itself when treated properly led to an interest in exploring other aspects of wellness, including diet, mindfulness and sustainability. The lights went on, sparking his innate entrepreneurial flair.MindBodyGreen was born, and the rest is history.I have been great friends with Jason and his wife Colleen for over six years. We have collaborated beautifully on a number of projects. And I have a sense of personal pride that we have both grown so much since our initial meeting back in 2008. He was one of my very first guests on the podcast, and today’s conversation picks up where RRP 32 leaves off.Specific topics covered include:I love this guy and have tremendous respect for his mission, what he has built and how he lives his life on a daily basis.Enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

February 21, 2016

“We imagine memory to be something that records or preserves the truth and that’s not what it does at all—it transforms what happened.”Mishka ShubalyDevoted listeners are well-acquainted with the gravelly voiced, predictably disheveled, typically homeless, chronically self-deprecating, sometimes tortured, but always charming, self-avowed nomadic povertarian commonly known as Mishka Shubaly — back on the podcast for a record-breaking 7th appearance.A writer oozing talent from his already overactive sebaceous glands, Mishka pens true stories about drink, drugs, disasters, desire, deception, and their aftermath. He began drinking at 13 and college at 15. At 22, he received the Dean’s Fellowship from the Master’s Writing Program at Columbia University. Upon receipt of his expensive MFA, he promptly moved into a Toyota minivan to tour the country nonstop as a singer-songwriter, often sharing the stage with comedians like Doug Stanhope and musical acts like The Strokes and The Yeah Yeah Yeahs.But mostly he drank.It sounds glamorous. It wasn’t. At 32, Mishka hit bottom, got sober and laced up a pair of running shoes. In between ultra marathons, he began publishing a string of #1 bestselling Kindle Singles – short non-fiction novellas — through Amazon. The Long Run*, his mini-memoir detailing his transformation from alcoholic drug abuser to sober ultrarunner, to this day remains one of the best-selling Kindle Singles in Amazon history.Today, Mishka’s on the cusp of releasing his very first book book. I Swear I’ll Make It Up To You – A Life On The Low Road* hits bookstores everywhere March 8, 2016.Brutally honest, fiercely emotional and muscular in its prose, it’s the booze-fueled, opiated account of a precocious young underachiever trying to be good (and failing and failing) until one day he succeeds. It’s about serial abandonment, school shootings, alcoholism, loneliness, artistic frustration, faith, guilt, sobriety, running, relationships, resentment, revenge, music, art, and creativity. It’s about one man’s attempt to reckon with the wreckage of his past and his journey to reconcile his relationship with his family, and most importantly, to forgive the father that jettisoned him.I love Mishka like a brother. I love this book. And I love this conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

February 14, 2016

“On Tuesday, I was a successful lawyer making six-figures. On Wednesday, I woke up handcuffed to a hospital bed charged with attempted murder. And then it got worse.”Joseph NausAddiction is a common theme on this podcast.But this week we sail into previously unchartered waters to tackle a dark and difficult subject:Sex addiction.Few taboos remain in our hyper-extroverted, selfie-fueled modern culture. But I think it’s safe to say this remains one of them.And yet 18 million – 24 million people in the U.S. alone suffer from this incredibly destructive affliction — that’s 6-8% of the population. But because this particular topic is so taboo, most locked in the grip of this prurient form of addiction are too terrified to reach out for help and thus suffer in isolation, silence and profound shame.Joseph Naus was one of them.Raised in hardscrabble poverty by a young, single mom — a heroin addict turned shut-in depressive — Joseph was desperate to find a way out. On sheer determination he succeeds, graduating Pepperdine Law School to become a respected lawyer.However, at age 32, his American Dream became a nightmare when his secret life as a sex addict collided with his not so secret alcoholism to destroy every aspect of his life with the explosive force of an atomic bomb.Convicted of a felony and disbarred, Joseph has spent the last twelve years learning humility the hard way: making a living doing everything from picking up the trash on film sets to selling outdoor kitchens at home shows for a former client, all while cleaning up the wreckage of his past and building a new life.Joseph’s tale is one of darkness, desperation and demons. It’s horrifying and it’s cautionary. But it’s also about redemption. Forgiveness. And the journey to find wholeness. A story laudably chronicled with distressing honesty and harrowing detail in Straight Pepper Diet: A Memoir*.I understand that some may cringe at the prospect of tuning in for this one. I get that. But on a personal level I feel a responsibility to tackle the subject. My aspiration is that this conversation provides a glimmer of hope for those imprisoned by this lonely, soul-eroding compulsion.It took courage for Joseph to sit down with me to openly share his story. I applaud that. So set aside your preconceptions and lend him your ear.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

“Let’s change our dialogue about food. Let’s change our dialogue about exercise. Let’s look at this stuff and let’s change the way we actually do research.”Ray CroniseIf you enjoyed my conversation with Dr. Rhonda Patrick, you’re going to love today’s conversation with my new friend Ray Cronise.A passionate innovator, disrupter and scientist, Ray began his career as a Materials Scientist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, where he worked for 15 years in Physical and Analytical Chemistry and Biophysics as Assistant Mission Scientist on four Spacelab missions and projects like the impact of microgravity on biophysics; and space station environmental life support systems.I have no idea what any of that means, but it sounds impressive.Ray went on to co-found ZERO-G— the world’s first private parabolic flight operation – with XPRIZE creator Peter Diamandis. Otherwise known as vomit comets, ZERO-G flights produce weightlessness and approximate space flight conditions for purposes of scientific research, cinema and entertainment.But it wasn’t until Tim Ferriss’ The 4-Hour Body* featured Ray’s pioneering work with cold stress therapy as as a tool for fat loss that Ray began popping up everywhere as the man behind the Metabolic Winter Hypothesis.Results motivated this prodigious scientific mind next to peer keenly into the chemistry, physiology, mechanics and research methodology behind human nutrition — specifically, what is wrong with current nutrition research and how to fix it. After copious investigation, analysis and self-experimentation, he has arrived upon a well supported but perhaps contrarian conclusion: a whole food plant-based diet is optimal for long-term health and wellness.Despite decades spent struggling to manage his own weight and stay fit, for the past six years Ray has kept the weight off using a combination of cold stress, healthful sleep cycles, and a plant-based nutritional regimen.Mainstream culture would deem Ray’s ways extreme. But ask Ray and he will tell you that the way most people live and eat today is actually a radical departure from our natural state and is likely the root cause of our epidemic of chronic lifestyle illness.After listening to this guy you will realize one thing – he did not arrive at his conclusions lightly. Conclusions soon to be explored in his upcoming book, Our Broken Plate, which aims to change the way people look at all diets so they can make lasting lifestyle changes that improve what Ray calls healthspan.Over the course of an amazing 3 hours, we cover an absurd amount of territory, including:Ray is next level when it comes to truly understanding how the body functions, and the profound impact of nutrition on physiological processes. So please enjoy this compelling deep dive into the mind and experiences of a rather remarkable man.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

347,Russell Simmons,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/russell-simmons/,"Episode 211
January 31, 2016

“It’s okay to get along with people you disagree with; in fact, it’s critical that we all try to put ourselves in other people’s shoes because I believe we all have the same hopes, desires. We are all inspired by the same kinds of things—we want to love and be loved.”Russell SimmonsIt’s rare to find a pop culture icon as devoted to raising consciousness as the man they call Rush.Hip hop impresario, entrepreneur extraordinaire, devoted yogi and long-time meditation practitioner, Russell Simmons is truly one-of-a-kind — incredibly warm, always quick with a captivating story you won’t soon forget and authentically committed to spreading awareness concerning important issues of our time — the horrors of animal agriculture, the declining state of human health (particularly in African American and lower socio-economic demographics) and the disastrous state of our planet’s dwindling environmental health.Most are familiar with Russell’s background, but in case his name is new to you, let’s break it open.Alongside Rick Rubin, in 1984 Russell co-founded Def Jam Recordings and quickly established himself as a prominent, guiding force in the quickly growing cultural revolution that became hip hop. Championing its breakout stars, Def Jam became the label by signing the movement’s ground-breaking forerunners – acts like the LL Cool J, Public Enemy, and The Beastie Boys.But Def Jam was just the first step in Russell’s empire building quest. Before selling the label to Universal Music Group in 1999 for $100 million, he formed RUSH Communications and quickly expanded his reach into artist management, apparel, and film & television projects like The Nutty Professor, Krush Groove, Gridlock’d and Def Comedy Jam.Russell’s current holdings include a vast array of entrepreneurial interests and philanthropic efforts, including All Def Digital, Argyleculture, RushCard, Global Grind, The Foundation For Ethnic Understanding and Tantris, a yoga & lifestyle destination currently in development.All of this is fascinating. But what interests me most about Russell is his personal journey. How discovering yoga and meditation led to his embrace of a vegan lifestyle. And the tremendous extent to which his commitment to cultivating an inner life based on the spiritual principles of ahimsa — a Sanskrit term for no harm — has impacted both his private and public life, his approach to business and his commitment to service and advocacy.Today we unpack all of it.This episode is definitely my most unique to date. Generally, I endeavor to architect the basic trajectory of my conversations; I know where I want to start and I know where I want to go. Suffice it to say this did not happen with Russell. Within the first 5 seconds of our conversation one thing was clear — I was not in control. Russell’s show, Russell’s flow.When the dust settled, all I could think was, what just happened?That’s charisma. This one’s different. But I loved every minute of it.Topics explored include:Note: This episode is chock-a-block with expletives. I typically run a clean, family-friendly show, but it’s more important to me to allow my guests to be who they are. Russell rolls thick and deep with language, so this week we will too. Pop on the headphones if the kiddies are within earshot.Finally, my son Tyler Piatt is moving on from his duties as day-one chief podcast audio engineer to focus on recording his first album. Ana Leimma features Tyler and my nephew Harrison Mathis swapping turns at song writing, lead vocals and lead guitar, accompanied by my other son Trapper on drums and Dylan Brosnan (yes, that Dylan Brosnan) on bass. Tyler joins me during the outro to say goodbye and take us out with a demo rendition of Ana Leimma’s Be Still. Dig it, listen/download below and send Ana Leimma some love on Facebook and Soundcloud. It’s the least you can do for all the hard work Tyler put into making this show the best it can be.I enjoyed my time with Russell and I think you will too. While you’re at it, pick up The Happy Vegan*— Russell’s easy-to-read primer on the ethical, health and environmental implications of our personal dietary choices with digestible, budget-conscious solutions for improving personal and planetary health through simple nutrition and lifestyle alterations.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

January 25, 2016

“You’ll never know the highest highs until you’ve experienced the lowest lows. I’ve been there.”Hunter McIntyreAt odds with the world seemingly since birth, the future wasn’t looking so bright for Hunter McIntyre.A misfit kid with uncontrollable attention deficit disorder, Hunter realized early and often he functioned on one mode no sedative or bipolar medication could possibly curb: full blast.Discovering drugs and alcohol at 14 give his ill-at-ease nature comfort, but trouble soon follows. A downward spiral that invites increased school suspensions; escalating run-ins with Johnny Law; and even a short-lived, unsuccessful stint at military school in West Virginia.Facing jail time or rehab for a drug-fueled senior year prank gone terribly awry, Hunter’s despairing parents ultimately ship him off to outpatient care in Montana, hoping clean air and big skies will bring grounding and perspective to young Hunter’s errant ways. But dirty drug tests follow, leading to incarceration-type rehab stays in Nevada and New Mexico.Ultimately Hunter’s sobriety officer intervenes, hooking him up with a logging job back in Montana.Hunter bulks up. Sober up? Not so much.The next chapter finds Hunter in Los Angeles, failing upward with lucrative modeling gigs for companies like J. Crew and Abercrombie and Fitch while setting his sights on becoming a celebrity personal trainer. But life goals are eclipsed by an ever-escalation in partying. Living the sun-drenched frat boy lifestyle in a Malibu bro-house, days and nights revolve around girls, ecstasy, mushrooms, acid, more girls and even more alcohol.A spontaneous booze-fueled, chest-pumping whim leads to Hunter and his Malibros challenging each other to sign up for a local Spartan Race — unchartered terrain for all involved. But come race day, only Hunter is able to drag his hung over body out of bed. Despite several beers enjoyed that morning, he nonetheless finishes ninth overall, just eight minutes behind world champion and 2:16 marathoner Hobie Call.And just like that, the lights turn on. It’s the wake up call Hunter needed. The rest is history.Immediately parting ways with his partying ways, purpose and focus take center stage. Almost overnight, Hunter morphs into the man they call The Sheriff, transforming himself into one of the world’s best obstacle course racers. A rare talent with the body and size of a cross fitter who not only excels at strength, speed and agility but also boasts the endurance of a Kenyan.Sponsorship offers soon follow. Magazine cover stories abound. And notoriety ensues, outpaced only by The Sheriff’s now famous, quickly growing ego.Full blast finally found a life.If you know anything about Hunter, you know he has a huge, at times controversial personality. But there is a thoughtful, far more contemplative side to this brash, outspoken athlete than meets the eye. I think you will be surprised by our conversation. I know I was.Specific topics explored include:I sincerely hope you enjoy our exchange.

“We’re actually on the verge of serious antibiotic resistance cropping up, and that is scary. It’s absolutely terrifying.”Rhonda PatrickThis episode is a geeky deep dive into the hardcore science behind everything from telomeres and the mechanisms behind aging and longevity to the primacy of maintaining microbiome health; oxidative stress and the relationship between inflammation and chronic disease; epigenetics and genetic disposition versus expression; and of course nutrition – divining truth from myth, the impact of micronutrient inadequacies, focused supplementation and the difference between eating for optimal wellness versus performance.Today’s guide through this byzantine labyrinth of crucial biological processes is my brilliant friend Rhonda Patrick, Ph.D.A Ph.D in biomedical sciences, Dr. Patrick is an expert in nutrition, metabolism and aging. She has done considerable research in all of these fields, including research on cancer and the effects of mineral and vitamin supplementation on metabolism, inflammation and aging. She did her graduate research at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, where she focused on cancer, mitochondrial metabolism and apoptosis. In addition, she conducts clinical trials and has performed extensive aging research at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.Beyond the fact that Rhonda is whip smart (and totally amazing), through her Found My Fitness blog, podcast and YouTube channel, she expertly translates the complexities of clinical research and physiological processes in understandable terms, adeptly communicates their implications and provides actionable real life practices and applications aimed at maximizing overall health and longevity.It’s time to put on the propellor hat and get out your pen and paper, because you’re going to want to take notes for this one.We cover a ton of material in this conversation.

350,Ask Me Anything,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/dont-compromise/,"Episode 208
January 14, 2016

“I’m just an individual who doesn’t feel that I need to have somebody qualify my work in any particular way. I’m working for me.”David BowieTechnically this is another episode of Ask Me Anything. But this week we don’t actually answer listener questions. This week we riff.This is a conversation about embracing the journey of becoming more of who you truly are. It’s about the commitment to evolve into your most authentic expression. It’s about the beauty and power of living an uncompromising, expansive, creative existence.There was a man who exemplified this ethos like no other. A man who never compromised. A man who expressed his creative truth with every fiber of his being, all the way down to his final breath.That man is the singular David Bowie. May you rest in peace, Ziggy Stardust.Today we reflect back on a remarkable life. From his example we mine the path to unlocking your own personal truth. And we weave our way back to one immutable truth — all roads to personal growth lead back to your commitment to you.As a related aside, and in case you missed it, enjoy this short movie about my recent visit to Beirut, Lebanon to run the marathon. I didn’t run for time. I ran for peace. An experience that uplifted me, then broke my heart. That’s what travel does — it breeds empathy.2016 is all about video for me. So if you enjoyed this little movie, subscribe to my YouTube Channel. I’ll be uploading a new video every week, so lots of cool stuff soon to come. For fun daily videos on my morning routines, nutrition, training, podcast behind the scenes and random musings, add me (iamrichroll) on Snapchat!In any event, enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

351,Colin O'Brady,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/colin-obrady/,"Episode 207
January 10, 2016

“For me it’s always been about the journey, about the adventure & about living my passion—that’s been enough reward for me.”Colin O’BradyAs I write this entry, it’s Sunday evening, January 10 around 8pm. Less than one hour ago, after days spent slogging across Antarctic desert in -30 celsius temperatures, 30-year old pro triathlete turned mountaineering adventure athlete Colin O’Brady reached the South Pole — the first stop on his world record quest to become the youngest and fastest human to ever complete the Explorers Grand Slam — an adventurers challenge to summit the highest mountain on each of the seven continents as well as trek to both the North and South Poles.Only 44 people in documented history have successfully completed the challenge. Of these, only 2 have done it under a year.Colin’s goal? Get it done in five months.If that’s not amazing enough, consider that just eight years ago, Colin faced the very real possibility he would never walk again.After graduating from Yale in 2006, Colin left to explore the world on a backpacking trip. While in Thailand, he suffered a tragic accident and was severely burned in a fire. His injuries covered nearly 25% of his body, causing potentially irrevocable damage to his legs and feet.Determined to beat the odds, he set a seemingly outlandish goal to not just walk again, but to complete a triathlon following his recovery. Colin didn’t just finish a triathlon. In his first attempt he won — stunning the multisport community with an overall amateur title at the prestigious 2009 Chicago Triathlon less than two years post-accident and after only a few months of training.On the day immediately following his victory, Colin turned pro, quit his job as a commodities trader, hopped a flight to Australia and spent the next five years representing the United States in triathlon competitions all over the world with a keen eye on landing an Olympic berth.Insane. And yet despite his amazing success, Colin sensed something missing from his life. He wanted more. A compulsion to more deeply explore uncertainty and precariousness that fatefully gave birth to the expedition he calls BEYOND 7/2. Colin just moments after successfully reaching the South Pole at 1:55 PST on January 10. The clock on the World Record attempt is now ticking!His inspiration isn’t fame, but pure adventure, buttressed by a conviction to land a blow to childhood obesity by raising $1 million on behalf of the Alliance For A Healthier Generation, a non-profit founded by the American Heart Association and the Clinton Foundation dedicated to helping kids to develop healthy habits.From his hippie upbringing to life at Yale, organic farming on Kauai, and the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual fortitude required to succeed in his world record attempt, this is an incredibly inspiring conversation with a young man courageously embracing fear to meet his absolute limits in search of meaning, place and giving back.We cover a lot of ground in today’s confab, including:I sincerely hope you enjoy this exchange with a remarkable human. Colin needs all the support we can give so let’s put some wind in his sails by taking a moment to send Colin a positive message on social media (links below).Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

January 3, 2016

“I’m a high school dropout. I’m a convicted felon. I can’t spell. I can’t type. I was homeless. I shot dope into my veins and I am not ashamed of any of that stuff because that’s what I had to do to survive… Whatever it is that you are suffering from, you can change. And you can change in such a profound way that within a short period of time you wont even recognize yourself anymore.”Khalil RafatiToday my good friend Khalil Rafati returns to the podcast.Most would call Khalil a successful wellness entrepreneur. SunLife Organics, his growing chain of organic juice bar cafés, can be seen popping up all over Southern California with more on the horizon.But it wasn’t that long ago that the only thing Khalil was successful at was getting high in the dark underbelly of the City of Angels.Addicted to shooting heroin and smoking crack, Khalil was soon overtaken by paranoia and psychosis and written off by friends and family. When he finally hit bottom, Khalil was 33 years old and 109 pounds, a convicted felon, high school dropout, and homeless junkie living in a cardboard box on the infamous Skid Row in downtown L.A.At the time, Khalil was hell bent on dying. But God, the Universe or whatever you want to call it had different plans. He didn’t just live — he repaired his life wholesale. A miracle of sobriety. Miracle.So how does someone with nothing, who feels like they deserve nothing, and who just wants to end it all turn their life around?Khalil’s story is nothing short of astounding, trumped only by his ability to tell it. So if you missed his first appearance on the show, listen up here.Today he drops by the podcast studio to pick up where we left off — a tale recently canonized in his recently released memoir I Forgot To Die*  — an incredible true story of pain, suffering, addiction and redemption and how one man ultimately conquered his demons and wrote himself a new life story.So let’s hear all about it. I sincerely hope you enjoy this conversation with one of my favorite people.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

December 20, 2015

“95% of all of the environmental issues out there trace back to animal agriculture and the havoc that it creates.”Suzy CameronPerhaps you know today’s guest from one of her 25+ roles on the silver screen appearing in movies like Titanic, Fandango and The Usual Suspects. Or maybe you know her as the better half of the world’s most successful film director, James Cameron – the incomparable mind behind the biggest cinematic blockbusters of all time: Aliens, Terminator, Titanic and of course Avatar – the highest grossing movie ever.But Suzy Amis Cameron is so much more than all that. In addition to raising five kids, she is a pioneering environmental activist. A passionate philanthropist. An education innovator. And the maverick co-founder (along with her sister Rebecca) of MUSE. Grabbing international headlines last year when it became the first U.S. school to implement a 100% plant-based school lunch program, MUSE is an incredibly progressive, paradigm breaking K-12 institution devoted to sustainability; creative & critical thinking; and preparing young people to live consciously within themselves, one another and the planet. A pretty great vision if you ask me.A living example of selfless advocacy in action, for the last 25 years Suzy has tirelessly dedicated herself to an array of environmental causes, working non-stop to reform education; combat global climate change; raze our execrable system of animal agriculture; overhaul our fatal addiction to the standard American diet; defeat chronic lifestyle disease; and engineer a better, healthier food system for all.Towards this end, in 2014 James and Suzy founded Food Choice Taskforce, a non-profit organization targeting the impact of animal agriculture on climate change to mobilize a global shift in food choice. She is also a founder of Food Forest Organics, a New Zealand-based plant-based cafe and marketplace, and Red Carpet Green Dress, showcasing socially and environmentally responsible fashions.This is a great conversation about her extraordinary life. It’s a conversation about the intricate, intertwined relationship between our actions and the biosphere. It’s about championing sustainable values – from what we do, to what we wear, to how we teach our children, to the food we eat. It’s about how our consumer choices impact our personal health and the current and future health of this spinning blue globe we call home. And of course, it’s about what it’s like to be married to Hollywood’s most successful director.Specific topics covered include:Suzy stirs me to do and be better. Listen in, and be equally inspired.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

December 17, 2015

“It’s about being able to be aware of the moment and its possibilities than it is about ruminating on what could have happened—I did live and I do live.”Trampas ThompsonToday’s guest isn’t famous. He hasn’t written a book. He’s not an in demand speaker.But I can almost promise that you have seen Trampas Thompson — you just didn’t know it.Working behind the scenes, Trampas is a Hollywood stuntmen extraordinaire, collecting blockbuster credits performing a dizzying array of delicious, death-defying acts in some of the world’s most popular movies and television shows.Trampas has run the streets on fire, sword battled with Johnny Depp in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and most recently doubled Michael Keaton in Birdman. Yes, that was Trampas, not Michael, who lept off a New York Theatre District rooftop in the most memorable scene from last year’s Oscar winning best picture.His credits are impressive: The Dark Knight Rises, National Treasure, 21 Jump Street, Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull, The Wolf of Wall Street, and on and on.But what drew me to Trampas as a great fit for the podcast actually has very little to do with his work. Far more fascinating? Who he is.What kind of person becomes a stuntman?God broke the mold with this guy. Larger than life, Trampas is one-of-a-kind. A renaissance man living life full throttle 24/7. The kind of guy who survived a skydiving accident when his parachute didn’t open, then jumped again. A person unapologetically himself, incapable of doing anything half-assed and utterly fearless.This is another epic, thoroughly entertaining 3-hour conversation with a truly singular human about living life on one’s own terms. It’s about dragonfly tattoos, synchronicity, Burning Man and the never ending spiritual quest to grow and expand consciousness.It’s about what it means to hand-wring the adventure out of life.I sincerely hope you enjoy this conversation with one of my favorite people.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

December 13, 2015

“Strength must build up, not destroy. It should outdo itself, not others who are weaker. Used without responsibility, it causes nothing but harm and death. I can lift the heaviest weights, but I cannot take the responsibility off my shoulders. Because the way we use our strength defines our fate. What traces will I leave on my path into the future? Do we really have to kill in order to live? My true strength lies in not seeing weakness as weakness. My strength needs no victims. My strength is my compassion.”Patrik BaboumianStrength isn’t just about physical prowess. Strength is about character.By this definition, vegan strongman Patrik Baboumian is perhaps the strongest man on Earth.Born in 1979 to Armenian parents in Abadan, Iran, Patrik and his family fled the Iranian revolution when he was seven and emigrated to central Germany. By the age of nine, he fell in love with wrestling on TV and soon developed an interest in weight training. As a young teen, he got into power lifting and bodybuilding, rising quickly through the ranks to become Germany’s national junior bodybuilding champion.For ethical reasons, in 2005 Patrik went vegetarian, accepting that this would likely undermine his performance goals. Instead, his improvement steadily escalated. So in 2011, he went completely vegan. And that’s when things really blew up for the guy they call the Armenian Viking.100% Plantpowered, over the last 4 years Patrik has been awarded the title of Germany’s Strongest Man, racked up multiple victories at the European Powerlifting Championships and set four Guinness World Records in various strength disciplines.We’re talking about a guy who can Bench 463 lbs. Squat 794 lbs. And Deadlift 794 lbs.This is a long way of saying that Patrik Baboumian is stronger than you are. And believe it or not, he has accomplished all of these extraordinary, superhuman feats without the one thing long-held conventional wisdom dictates is absolutely necessary to optimally perform as an elite strength athlete: animal protein.I first met Patrik at the 2013 at the Toronto VegFest, where I stood on the WestJet Stage at Harbourfront Centre before a crowd 1,000 deep to cheer him towards a Guinness World Record setting yoke walk — a feat that entailed carrying 1,216 pounds (550kilos) a distance of 10 meters in less than 60 seconds (which he recently bettered to a current 560kg world record, completed in just 28 seconds). Spontaneously grabbing for my GoPro, I shot this little video documenting the astounding accomplishment:But Patrik’s greatest strength is not his physical prowess. His greatest strength is his compassion.Breaking strongman world records is what Patrik does. But beyond the accomplishments and beneath the beast-like exterior lives a sensitive, gentle soul. An exemplary human of steadfast ethics whose conscience refuses to allow animals to suffer for the sake of his superhuman athletic goals. In stark contradiction to culturally entrenched notions of masculinity, Patrick performs his feats in the name of compassion — a threatening word too often misinterpreted as weakness that challenges predominant male gender role stereotypes and obliges us to rethink social priorities.My hope is that Patrik’s example will open your mind. Compel you to question long-held, conventional notions concerning the relationship between nutrition and athletic performance. Reform stereotypical definitions of masculinity to embrace the responsibility mankind shoulders as protector of the voiceless. Reframe your interpretation of compassion not as weakness, but as our greatest strength. Stir you to think more deeply about your consumer choices. And ultimately inspire you to challenge your own personal limitations.Specific topics covered include:I sincerely hope you enjoy this epic 3-hour adventure with the Armenian Viking, the Human Wolverine, the original vegan badass — my friend Patrik.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

December 9, 2015

“It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.”Marcus AureliusLast episode we learned how How Not To Die.Today we contemplate the flip side: How To Die.Everybody dies. Everybody. Of course we know this to be true. But when was the last time you had a direct experience with someone in the grips of the undeniable reality that afflicts us all without exception? Most people have never even seen a dead person, let alone held the hand of someone expiring their last breath.Why is the one thing we all share in common seemingly deleted from our daily human experience?Because  our culture is carefully crafted to obscure, whitewash, sanitize and obviate every unpalatable aspect of the frightening reality that scares the shit out of us more than anything else.As a result, we sleepwalk through life pretending it doesn’t exist. Subconsciously, we might even harbor the completely insane thought that somehow, some way, we will be the exception to the rule and find a way to escape such distasteful finality.Then, when death rears it’s unfamiliar head (it always does), we recoil. We get uncomfortable. Paralyzed by fear and morbidity, we stumble with our words. Lacking the capacity to even have an open and honest conversation about it, we retreat into a shame spiral.Death breeds fear. Fear breeds resistance. Resistance breeds denial. And denial never helped anyone.This is not a healthy relationship with death.So let go of the fear. Free yourself of the resistance. And let’s form a new relationship with death. One that not only acknowledges it, but embraces it as our most potent communal experience. One that guilds our lives with meaning. One that allows us to be more present in our lives. One that unites rather than divides. One that provides fertile soil for gratitude.For me, these concepts are not academic. As I type, Julie’s 92-year old father is on his deathbed. It is unlikely he will live to see the weekend. And so for the last several days, our lives have been on hold as our children and extended family have gathered around Larry Mathis to celebrate his remarkable life. We’ve told stories. Sung songs. Held his hand. Kissed his forehead. Said our goodbyes as he slips out of conscious awareness.This week we’ve talked a lot about death. This podcast is an extension of that ongoing conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

December 6, 2015

“I continue to be amazed by our bodies’ ability for self-repair. Our bodies want to be healthy, if we would just let them. That’s what these new research articles are showing: even after years of beating yourself up with a horrible diet, your body can reverse the damage, open back up the arteries and even reverse the progression of some cancers. So it’s never too late to start exercising and never too late to start eating healthier.”Michael Greger, MDA graduate of Cornell and Tufts University School of Medicine, Dr. Greger has published in a litany of scientific journals, testified before Congress and lectured at countless symposiums and institutions, including the Conference on World Affairs and the National Institutes of Health. He was even an expert witness in the infamous Oprah Winfrey meat defamation lawsuit and has appeared all over television on shows like Dr. Oz and The Colbert Report.By day, Michael Greger, MD, FACLM can be found crafting high level policy initiatives as Director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture for the Humane Society of the U.S. But more often than not he’s traipsing the globe, hopping from podium to podium to deliver one of the hundreds of lectures he serves up annually.By night, Dr. Greger scours thousands of medical journals in search of the world’s best, most objective nutrition research to bring you free videos and articles every single day as chief wizard behind NutritionFacts.org— the world’s most authoritative, non-profit online destination for all things nutrition, health and disease prevention.If you’ve never before visited this site, I highly suggest you check it out immediately. A comprehensive clearinghouse that inspects every imaginable facet of nutrition and health, NutritionFacts.org features hundreds of impeccably researched, easily understandable and straight to the point videos — always my first stop when I want to get to the bottom of any question I have about food, diet and disease.Apparently Dr. Greger doesn’t sleep. Because amidst all of this, he still found time to write a new book that hits booksellers everywhere this week. But How Not To Die* isn’t just any book — it’s a straight up game changing must read. Clocking in at over 600 pages, it’s an exhaustive, heavily researched, encyclopedic examination of how nutritional and lifestyle interventions can help prevent and even reverse the 15 top causes of premature death in America.Not only has Dr. Greger delivered a ground-breaking tome for the ages, 100% of fees and proceeds he receives from speaking and book sales are donated to charity.Quite a powerful testament to this man’s level of selfless service to humanity.If you are a long-time listener, you know Dr. G and I go way back. He was one of my very first guests on the RRP. Now he’s back to talk more about his life, his research, and How Not To Die – a subject I think we can all get behind.Specifics covered include:Dr. Greger is one of my very favorite people on the planet.

“Champions aren’t made in the gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them — a desire, a dream, a vision.”Muhammad AliWe tend to assume the successful are simply gifted. Or perhaps just lucky — at the right place at the right time.Olaniyi Sobomehin is not one of those people.But he does have one thing most lack: vision and self-belief.A middle child with a life long dream to play in the NFL, Niyi lacked the natural gifts required to even earn a college football scholarship. Friends and family repeated the refrain: be realistic. Niyi ignored the advice, invested in himself and walked on the Oregon State program with little to no chance of seeing game time.But sheer determination, exceptional mental toughness, and an unparalleled ability to out work everyone on the field turned this no name walk on into a running back for The New Orleans Saints, where he finally realized his childhood dream playing alongside NFL greats like Drew Brees.A voracious reader able to translate wisdom into actionable practices, Niyi understood that the tools he relied upon for athletic success would apply equally to life after football. So upon retirement he turned his professional focus to  I’m Not You— a platform to help young athletes develop the habits, strategies, systems and techniques required to maximize potential in sport and life.Niyi’s approach has little to do with physical training. It’s about overcoming mental limitations. It’s about mindset. Because the relationship one has with one’s self is what ultimately dictates outcomes.In other words, it’s an inside job.Today we talk about the strategies Niyi distilled from playing at the highest level of sport and how these tools can be applied to unlock your own inner potential.Specifics include:I love this guy’s passion. Niyi’s enthusiasm for life and devotion to service is infectious, buttressed by a perspective germane well beyond the boundaries of sport. So even if you’re not an athlete, this conversation delivers. Chocked with copious gems applicable to every facet of personal and professional development, it’s a natural bookend to echo and complement my preceding conversation with Jesse Itzler and the principles he learned living with Navy SEAL David Goggins.Question: What Belief About Yourself Is Holding You Back?I’d love to hear all about it in the comments section below.I sincerely hope you enjoy this walk in Niyi’s cleats as much as I did.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

November 29, 2015

“The only way to really get better is to experience pain, to get uncomfortable, go to places that you don’t want to go, and improve.”Jesse ItzlerJesse Itzler fast-talked his way right out of college into a recording contract, ultimately taking his music all the way to MTV, the Billboard 100 and even an Emmy.Jesse Itzler then took an entrepreneurial left-turn, creating and selling big companies — companies like Marquis Jet, the world’s largest prepaid private jet card company, and Zico Coconut Water — before wooing Spanx founder Sarah Blakely (worth over $1 billion) all the way to the altar.Jesse Itzler eats only fruit before noon. And when he’s not raising three kids, he runs 100 mile races, raises millions for charity and can be found court side supporting the Atlanta Hawks — the NBA team he recently purchased with some friends.What I’m trying to say is that Jesse Itzler is a quite the character. An amazing life highlighted by one predominant theme:never be afraid to fail.But there is one thing that scares Jesse Itzler: stagnation.Despite all his success, in 2010 Jesse felt his life had settled into a too-comfortable routine. So he did what any rational human would do: he invited a Navy SEAL to move in with him.But this was no ordinary SEAL (as if any such thing exists). This was David Goggins — perhaps the most intense, taciturn individual walking planet Earth. A one man metaphor for adversity destruction, Goggins’ example and words formed the original inspiration behind my own journey:When you think you are done, you’ve only accomplished about 40% of what you are truly capable of.Goggins military record is astonishing. As a Navy SEAL, he was one of an elite group of men regularly sent on some of the toughest missions in the world. He is the only member in the U.S. Armed Forces to complete SEAL training, Army Ranger School (where he graduated as Honor Man), and Air Force tactical air controller training. Not only has he faced combat in Iraq, he served as the body guard for Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari.To honor his brother soldiers felled by battle and to raise money for charity, David lost 100 pounds in 60 days and went on to tackle the 10 most rigorous ultra-endurance challenges on the planet, compelling his 260-pound frame to top finishes at races like Badwater— a 135 mile jaunt across Death Valley in 130 degree heat (finishing 5th as a novice) — and Ultraman— 1 320-mile 3 day triathlon circumnavigation of the Big Island of Hawaii he completed with his tennis shoes duct taped to the pedals of an ill-fitting loaner bike to a 2nd place finish overall. He even completed 203.5 miles in the 48-Hour National Championship endurance foot race, earning a spot among the top 20 ultra-marathoners of the world.Just another training day for Goggins, topped off with a recent Guinness World record for most pull ups in a single day: 4,025.Goggins accepted Jesse’s invitation with just one rule: for 31-days, Jesse had to do every thing David asked him to do. No exceptions.What happened next would change Jesse’s life forever. An adventure chronicled in his new book, Living With A Seal: 31 Days Training With The Toughest Man On The Planet*. I found the book super fun and highly entertaining. So when my travels took me to Atlanta, I jumped at the chance to meet up with him.This is a fun conversation about about Jesse’s dynamic, extraordinary life. His success equation. Why growth is crucial to happiness. Why we must always be willing to get uncomfortable. Why it’s important to never settle, never stagnate, and most of all, why we must never, ever be afraid to fail.Specific topics include:Question: Are you living on a plateau? What are you willing to do to continually grow?I’d love to hear all about it in the comments section below.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Cultivate the habit of being grateful for every good thing that comes to you, and to give thanks continuously. And because all things have contributed to your advancement, you should include all things in your gratitude.”Ralph Waldo EmersonThe holidays are a time of year for gratitude. So why do so many find it so hard to celebrate?There’s a brisk chill outside. By late afternoon it’s already dark. Our circadian rhythm dictates we slow down, hunker down and hibernate. But for the next month, we ignore the call of nature, mindlessly hurling ourselves into a frenzied state of overcommitted overextension.Too many obligations. Overspending on things nobody really needs. Keeping up with the Joneses yet never quite matching up.Stress. Anxiety. Conflict. Dread. Debt. But perhaps the biggest trigger of all? Family drama.The treachery of extended family holiday get-togethers can accelerate a perilous emotional state to the breaking point. The patterns are age-old and hard wired, yet each year we make the promise: this time will be different. But then like clockwork, the buttons get pushed. Patience? Mindfulness? Forget it. Reason and composure vanishes, replaced with primal reaction. The spark is lit, and once again you’re once riding that emotional rollercoaster you vowed to finally avoid.Depression ensues, only to wake up in January with an emotional hangover no narcotic can salve.What if you could break the pattern?This week Julie and I delve deep into strategies for a new and better holiday experience. Tips and tools to reframe the dynamic, gracefully navigate the emotional minefields, sidestep the consumerist insanity and embrace the fundamental spirit that is meant to define this time of year — gratitude.Specific topics include:The show concludes with Humming— a brief humming meditation track written and performed by Julie from her album Jai Home.

November 22, 2015

“I don’t think that people purposely want to live a life full of cruelty or necessarily want to add more greenhouse gases to the earth, but there’s something that happens when you go through this process — you become more conscious. And it’s not until you become more conscious that you can actually see what’s in front of you.”Marco BorgesMaybe you know Marco Borges because he trains people like Pharrell. Perhaps you know him as the guy who inspired Jay-Z and Beyoncé (who he also trains) to adopt a plant-based lifestyle, then partnered up with them to launch 22-Days Nutrition – a plant-based nutrition products and meal delivery service that shuttles organic, plant-based gluten-free, soy-free and dairy-free meals anywhere in the U.S., right to your doorstep.I had never met Marco. In fact, until this past Spring, I had never even heard of him. But all that changed in April when this Miami-based celebrity fitness trainer, exercise physiologist and plant-based evangelist was suddenly everywhere: the TODAY show, Good Morning America, TIME magazine and even places like Vogue, Entertainment Tonight, Ryan Secrest and Perez Hilton. A Jay & Bey infused media blitz that launched this guy from below the radar to massive mainstream popularity, fomented a plant-based zeitgeist frenzy and skyrocketed his new book, The 22-Day Revolution: The Plant-Based Program That Will Transform Your Body*, to the top of the New York Times Bestseller list.When the most culturally significant and influential entertainment couple on the planet embraces the plant-based perspective (even if imperfectly or temporarily), it’s a big deal. The seismic impact can’t be underestimated. People don’t just notice — the tectonic plates of popular culture shift. Conventional attitudes and habits around food change. Our social paradigm forever altered.So who is the man behind all this?In full disclosure, my biggest fear was that Marco would be just another trainer leveraging celebrity relationships for personal notoriety and fortune.But contempt prior to investigation is a recipe for ignorance. I was delighted to discover a remarkable man. A man that completely defies the stereotype and put to rest any questions I may have harbored about the motivations behind his mission.Marco Borges is true blue. The real deal. A husband and father of three young boys who — at his very core — is about service.

364,Aaron Peirsol,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/aaron-peirsol/,"Episode 194
November 15, 2015

“Basically you have a love affair with that task and you find yourself in it: it’s meditation. And that’s what water, ever since I was a kid, was for me…it was always a matter of trying to see how deep my relationship could be with the water.”Aaron PeirsolIf you follow competitive swimming, Aaron Peirsol needs no introduction.The commonly spun narrative goes something like this: the greatest backstroker in swimming history, Aaron Peirsol is a giant among men. The very definition of a high performing elite athlete with a slew of world-records and Olympic gold medals to prove it.But Aaron is not his career. Aaron Peirsol is different.Let’s set the stage. Aaron burst onto the international swimming scene at the age of 17, walking away from the 2000 Sydney Olympics with a silver medal in the 200m backstroke. At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Aaron won gold in both the 100m and 200m backstroke (that one by an incredible 2.5 secs) and a third gold leading off the 4×100 medley relay. At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, Aaron took gold in the 100m backstroke and the 4×100 medley relay, taking silver in the 200m back behind teammate Ryan Lochte.The following year, Aaron raised the bar one last time with a stunning 1:51.93 world record setting performance in the 200m backstroke at the World Championships in Rome — a world record that to this day still stands – an astonishing 6 years later.7 Olympic medals. 5 gold, 2 silver. 10 long-course World Championships.Aaron is of course incredibly proud of his accomplishments. But victories, defeats, podiums and bling fail to tell the story of Aaron Peirsol. They are not who he is.Over the course of his career, I vividly recall watching Aaron on television — one triumph after another. But far more interesting than his performances was how he acquitted himself outside the pool. There is just something completely unique about this guy. He is unlike any other high performing athlete I know.More contemplative. Consistently thoughtful. A bit soft spoken. And always laid back.More soul surfer than Type-A competitor.How does a guy so chill thrive in such a pressure cooker universe? Not just through 1 Olympiad but 3?Today I get answers. Today we enter the world of elite competitive swimming. A consideration of his career and the elements required to not just win, but keep winning. But most of the conversation centers around character — what makes Aaron tick.His perspective might surprise you. Because for Aaron, it’s not about competition – it never was.For him, it’s about a lifelong love affair with water.For him, it’s always been a spiritual journey.Specifics covered today include:What is the core motivation behind your passion?I’d love to hear all about it in the comments section below.Aaron is a special guy. It was an honor to spend time with him. I think you will feel the same.

November 8, 2015

“There is no question that the number one food to eat to grow a good gut garden is plant fiber, and there really can be no debate about that.”Robynne Chutkan, MDOur bodies are comprised of about ten trillion cells. But our microbiome — all the bacteria, viruses, and fungi that live in or on our bodies – outnumber human cells by a factor of 10. Therefore, it can be said that we are far more microorganism than human.We choose to believe that we are sentient beings, responsible for our health, moods and decisions. But the crazy truth is that to a large extent, our emotional state, propensity for disease and even our specific food cravings can all be traced back to the nature of our gut ecology.Most of these microorganisms are symbiotic. Maintaining a healthy culture of the right microorganisms is fundamental to good health. But should the quality of your microbiome go awry, health havoc ensues.This week on the show we delve deep into the nuts and bolts of this fascinating and quickly evolving field of medicine with respected gastroenterologist, microbiome expert and avid marathoner Robynne Chutkan, MD ( @DrChutkan ).A graduate of Yale, Dr. Chutkan received her medical degree from Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, where she also did her internship and residency and served as Chief Resident. She completed her fellowship in gastroenterology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York and has been on the faculty at Georgetown University Hospital since 1997.In 2004, Dr, Chutkan founded the Digestive Center for Women, an integrative gastroenterology practice that incorporates nutritional optimization, exercise physiology, biofeedback, and stress reduction as part of the therapeutic approach to digestive disorders.Lecturing throughout the United States and Europe, Dr. Chutkan has authored dozens of journal articles; serves as medical consultant and on air talent for the Discover Health Channel; is a member of the medical advisory board for the Dr. Oz Show (where she has appeared as a regular guest); and has also made national appearances on The Today Show, The Morning Show, and The Doctors.Consistently named one of the area’s best doctors by Washingtonian magazine, Dr. Chutkan is also the author of two bestselling books, Gutbliss* and most recently, The Microbiome Solution*.Specific topics covered today include:I’ve known Robynne for a couple years. Delightful and whip smart, she’s an absolute expert when it comes to effectively communicating her experience and understanding of microbiome health in a way that is relatable and easily understood by the lay person.This is an absolutely fascinating conversation on all facets of gut and skin health that just might change how you eat; how you shop for consumer hygiene and cleansing products; how you bathe (or don’t bathe); and simply, how you live.Change your microbiome, change your life. Or as Dr. Chutkan is fond of saying: live dirty, eat clean.Today we find out how and why.

367,Daryl Wein & Zoe Lister-Jones,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/consumed/,"Episode 191
November 4, 2015

“What they say all the time is: GMOs are saving the world, they are going to save the world, they are going to feed the world. The truth of the matter is, and this is a fact, we have enough food already to feed the world. It’s not about making more food—it is about better distributing the food we have.”Daryl WeinMost people don’t know that 80% of all processed foods currently contain genetically modified organisms.In fact, 54% Americans know virtually nothing whatsoever about the subject of GMOs.Filmmakers Daryl Wein and Zoe Lister Jones hope to change all that.Enter Consumed— the very first narrative feature film to tackle the quite controversial and incendiary subject of genetically engineered food.In the vein of Silkwood, Erin Brockovich and Traffic, Consumed is a taught political thriller of intersecting storylines that pivot around a mother’s investigation into her son’s illness and a series of archetypal characters that ultimately collide in the tangled world of genetically modified foods.Based on a co-written script directed by Daryl that stars Zoe as the mother, I first met the hyper-kinetic Daryl and his glowing and dynamic wife Zoe at a dinner party just before they commenced production on the film. I was impressed by how informed and passionate they were about the subject of GMO. Even more impressive was their ambition and courage to tackle such a hot button issue on film. That night I made them promise to come on the podcast when the film was complete to tell us all about it. That day is today.Zoe and Daryl launched their relationship at NYU in 2002. Then they launched their careers, combining talents on two low budget relationship comedies, Breaking Upwards (SXSW, 2009) and Lola Versus (Fox Searchlight, 2012).The films were so well received, the New York Times dubbed them, “Brooklyn’s answer to the Hollywood power couple,” establishing the pair as fresh new talents on New York’s independent film landscape alongside generational peers like Girls’ Lena Dunham.The prudent career move for Daryl and Zoe would have been to stay in Brooklyn. Further cultivate their very New York sensibility. Continue making relationship comedies. And carve out fine careers in the vein of Woody Allen or Noah Baumbach.Instead, they moved to Los Angeles and quickly set up a variety of film projects currently in development. Zoe started consistently showing up in movies and on television (she currently stars in Life In Pieces on CBS with Colin Hanks and Diane Weist). But most of all, they rolled up their sleeves and got to work crafting a complex, intricate independently financed drama about the world of GMOs. Ballsy!Last Spring, Consumed premiered to positive acclaim at the Los Angeles Film Festival. Starring Zoe alongside a stellar cast that includes Danny Glover, Victor Garber, Griffin Dunne, Anthony Edwards and Taylor Kinney, it’s just a really well done movie — I’ve watched it twice – topical, socially impactful and entertaining.But let’s be clear — it’s not a documentary. It doesn’t presuppose to answer questions, only ask them.Today I sit down with today’s guests to ask a few questions of my own.This is a very fun but at times heavy conversation that confronts the complex issues raised by GMOs and addresses the multi-faceted debate that swirls around it. Topics include:Like today’s guests, I’m not a scientist. None of us play one on film nor on the internet. The GMO debate is nothing if not polarizing. I don’t purport to have total clarity or all the answers. But I do know this: man is prone to hubris, particularly when it comes to bending nature to his will. Given that no peer reviewed studies exist on long-term effects, GMO food is perhaps the planet’s greatest experiment in human health. Ever.For this and other reasons, I am a staunch supporter of mandatory labeling laws. I simply believe that as consumers we have a fundamental right to know what’s in our food as a prerequisite to informed choice.If you are interested in seeing Consumed, public screenings are currently rolling out over 100 U.S. theatres via a really interesting new crowd-sourcing distribution platform called Gathr. To find a screening near you or to organize your own, visit consumedthemovie.com/screenings.I applaud Daryl and Zoe’s mission to introduce the world of GMOs to mainstream audiences and appreciate their willingness to share their perspective with all of you today.

November 1, 2015

“It’s absolutely incumbent upon us to envision a world where we produce food that is good for the planet and is good for our bodies and is affordable for everybody. And if we can do that we will pass a world along that is regenerative, sustainable, and equitable.”Gunnar LovelaceWho has time for ‘wellness’? I’m just trying to pay the bills.I would love to eat healthy, but I simply can’t afford it.When it comes to great food – plant-based or otherwise — the common refrain is that its either too expensive, inconvenient or simply unavailable. Often it’s all of the above. Although I often rebut several myths that swirl around these arguments, it’s undeniable that there is much truth in these assertions. Whole Foods has earned the moniker Whole Paycheck for a reason. If we want to truly redress our health care problems, we need to lay ruin to the elitism that so unfortunately undermines populist accessibility to optimal nutrition.In order to achieve this end, we must disrupt traditional supply chain methods. Combat special interests that entrench the status quo. Eliminate overpaid middle men. And leverage forward-thinking innovation to improve access, convenience and affordability to healthy food beyond the well healed for those who need it most — everyone.Gunnar Lovelace to the rescue.Yes, that is his real name. A life-long wellness advocate reared on a true-to-life commune by a single mom, Gunnar inherited his passion for health, yoga, mindfulness and expanded consciousness at birth — long before it became a zeitgeist thing. Gunnar and I go way back. Years before my personal transformation. I still vividly recall our initial meeting when he walked into my law office in 2000 to discuss representation of his venture of the moment, GoodLife — an early internet socially conscious Yelp. On his feet were sandals. In his hand? A large mason jar filled with a mysterious and murky green sludge. What is that? Who brings something like that to a meeting with a lawyer? My very first glimpse of what I did not know at the time would later become a staple of my life.Well ahead of its time, GoodLife fell victim to the dot-com bubble of the early aughts. But a long-lasting friendship survived.A serial entrepreneur, now Gunnar is back and on to something big — very big — as the founder and co-CEO of a new business that represents a seismic shift in affordable access to healthy food — Thrive Market.The digital love child of Costco and Whole Foods, Thrive is a direct to consumer, online shopping club platform that offers over 4,000 of best, healthiest, most popular natural and organic food brands in the world, but at a staggering 25-50% off typical retail prices, shipped anywhere in the United States for free.How do they do it? By eliminating all the aforementioned middle men — the brokers, slotting fees and pay-to-play that is endemic in the food industry — and passing that savings along to members. In addition, for every paid membership to Thrive ($60 / year), they give a free membership to a low income family, a teacher, or a military vet.Although founded less than two years ago, Thrive is growing incredibly fast. Beyond notable seed investors like Tony Robbins and Deepak Chopra, this past summer they closed a $30M Series A round of venture funding led by Greycroft with participants like John Legend, Toby Maguire & Demi Moore. These funds are already hard at work fulfilling Thrive’s mission statement, which is to make healthy living easy and affordable for every American family. Good news for everyone.Not your typical startup founder, Gunnar’s keen business acumen inhabits the ethos of a yoga teacher. He’s got a huge heart. He’s one of the good guys. And I am super proud of what he is building — a positive, quantum shift in the socio-economic fulcrum to broaden healthy food access for all.NOTE: Just in case you are wondering, this is NOT a paid endorsement of Thrive. Based on our long-standing friendship and consistent missions, Gunnar and Thrive graciously contributed to our cookbook pre-order campaign last May. However, I have no financial involvement or relationship with the company. I simply appreciate Gunnar and have been wanting to get him on the show for a long time. That said, and in complete transparency, in the aftermath of my conversation with Gunnar we have discussed the possibility of Thrive sponsoring future episodes of the podcast, which I would welcome given the simpatico nature of our shared interests.This is a a great conversation that spans a variety of general topics, including entrepreneurship, social responsibility, conscious capitalism, the current state of health in America and solving the problem of providing easy and affordable access to healthy food for everyone. Specifics include:It’s my honor to introduce you to my friend Gunnar.

369,Lewis Howes,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/lewis-howes-189/,"Episode 189
October 28, 2015

“The key to success in life is relationships. And the key to powerful relationships is vulnerability and being real. That’s the quickest way to build a relationship and create connection with someone.”Lewis HowesThis week I celebrate my friend and fellow podcaster Lewis Howes, host of The School of Greatness.I met Lewis a couple years ago when we were both newbie podcasters. He did my show. I did his show. Friendship ensued.A former professional football player and team handball Olympic hopeful who bottomed out before blossoming into a successful online entrepreneur, Lewis defies the stereotype that typically accompanies most successful alpha males. With a glint in his eye, Lewis is warm, incredibly giving, and a stellar example of what life can be like when your heart is open — gratitude in motion.After an injury prematurely ended his football career, Lewis was depressed, aimless and broke. Yearning for inspiration as he convalesced on his sister’s couch, he arrived at a question:What kind of life do I want to lead?Then he got to work. He sought out mentors — people thriving on their own terms. Applying the wisdom of those he respected, he began to create a vision for himself. He learned how to turn adversity into advantage.

October 25, 2015

“The difference between passion and addiction is that between a divine spark and a flame that incinerates.”Gabor MatéWhat if everything you presuppose about addiction is wrong?Enter Gabor Maté.World renowned lecturer, physician and bestselling author, today’s guest is a highly distinguished, in demand and at times controversial authority with a wealth of expertise on a range of topics that span addiction, stress and childhood development.With over twelve years of first hand experience working up close and personal on Vancouver’s skid row with patients severely challenged by hard core drug addictions, mental illness and HIV, Dr. Maté has cultivated a powerful yet eminently commonsensical perspective on this devastating affliction that contravenes conventional medical dogma. A perspective that begins with a single edict:Addiction is not a choice.Moreover, addiction has little to do with illicit substances. It’s just not about drugs. Or gambling, or shopping, or porn or whatever behavior happens to, in the words of Dr. Maté, incinerate the lives of millions.Instead, addiction is about the emotional pain behind the behavior. And healing is about confronting the past and untangling the circumstances that drive the individual to self-medicate in maddening defiance of all reason and logic.Based on cutting edge science, case studies and a wealth of personal experience, Dr. Maté concludes that addiction is a predisposition programmed in early years — an infestation that lurks miles beyond choice. A disease rooted neither in genetics nor free will but rather in environmental factors that hard wire brain neurochemistry during formative childhood development. Accordingly, those that suffer should not be shamed or criminalized, but instead treated in the same way we approach anyone suffering from cancer or an autoimmune disease — not with blame but rather with compassion, sympathy and medical intervention.As an author, Dr. Maté has written extensively on the subjects of addiction, early childhood development & trauma, attention deficit disorder, and the relationship between stress and disease. His most recent award-winning book, In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction* (a #1 bestseller in Canada) mixes personal stories with science to present a radical re-envisioning of addiction not as a discrete phenomenon confined to an unfortunate or weak-willed few, but as a continuum that runs throughout (and perhaps underpins) our society at large; not a medical “condition” distinct from the lives it affects, but rather the result of a complex interplay among personal history, emotional, and neurological development, brain chemistry, and the drugs (and behaviors) of addiction.In other words, it’s complicated. There is no miracle cure. There is no quick fix. But hope breathes in compassion and self-understanding — the first key to promoting healing and wellness,Dr. Maté’s work — and this book in particular — have been absolutely revelatory in helping me better understand myself, my personal history with addiction, and my ever evolving quest for greater well being. He changed my life. And I truly believe his message holds the power to improve the lives of anyone personally or tangentially impacted by addiction. And let’s face it — in this day and age that includes almost everyone.It was a unique honor to hold space with this compelling, paradigm breaking man. A conversation that begins with a survey of his life and labors but then subtly shifts — the verbal fulcrum slowly sliding until his focused insight was quite unsuspectedly yet keenly turned on me. The interviewer as patient; my own private session writ large.Topics covered include:Question: How can you treat those who suffer from addiction with more compassion?I look forward to hearing all about it in the comments section below.I love this conversation and hope it leaves you rethinking assumptions about human behavior and perhaps even your own behavioral compulsions.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“The choice to pursue a dream, at the destruction of my comfort, with the loss of safety and certainty, all for the purpose of doing something that inspires others to a fuller life of wonder and creativity and quality, to me that is a burden of responsibility worth carrying. To me, that is growing up.”Jedidiah JenkinsAuthor, global adventurer, social entrepreneur, human rights activist & lawyer, filmmaker and overall beautiful human.All of these labels certainly befit today’s guest, yet all somehow manage to fall short.I can’t quite recall how Jedidiah Jenkins first came across my radar. What I do remember is happening upon his rather stunning Instagram feed as he neared the end of a spectacular bicycle powered journey in Patagonia.Each photograph more arresting than the one prior, every image conveyed it’s own story that perfectly informed an engaging larger narrative. But it’s Jedidiah’s accompanying entries — beautifully composed, contemplative and quite poetic — that set his feed apart. Writings themed less by place than interior geography, it’s Instagram as dynamic journal — an experiment in blogging that camps out hundreds of miles beyond any travelogue, blog or vlog you’ve ever before seen.I was hypnotized. Who is this guy?A graduate of the USC School of Cinematic Arts and Pepperdine University School of Law, Jedidiah began his professional career as one of the founding leaders of Invisible Children, the small non-profit that overnight became world renown courtesy of a little social justice campaign you might have heard of called #Kony2012— a campaign that redefined internet virality.The progeny of adventurer journalist parents who quite famously graced the cover of National Geographic walking across America in the 1970’s, I think it’s fair to say that despite his deskbound legal career, Jedidiah and the outdoors had a little destiny to sort out. And so, to celebrate his 30th birthday, Jedidiah quit the job he loved to unconsciously follow in his parents’ footsteps, scare himself, embrace the unknown and, like a character out of a Mark Twain novel, light out on the territory.In August, 2013, on two wheels powered only by two legs, Oregon to Patagonia began in Florence, Oregon and culminated in Patagonia is January 2015. A sixteen-month, 10,000 mile journey elegantly and thoughtfully captured and shared on his incredibly popular Instagram feed and soon to be the subject of his first bookIn so many ways, Jedidiah is exactly who I expected him to be. And yet his wit and warmth somehow managed to surprise me — a guy deeply connected to his personal truth and just so refreshingly present.This is a phenomenal conversation about:Jedidiah is a very special guy. I am very excited to share this one with you.

“When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they seem invincible but in the end, they always fall — think of it, ALWAYS.”Mahatma GhandiToday I am pleased to offer a conversation with environmentalist, engineer and technologist Sailesh Rao, the founder and Executive Director of environmental non-profit Climate Healers.With a focus on ahimsa — the Sanskrit word for non-violence — as an essential and perhaps the most powerful response to climate change, Climate Healers promotes technological and engineering advances aimed at clean air and reforestation. Partnering with NGOs, tribal villages, and school clubs, current projects include efforts to devise an affordable and high-functioning solar powered stove to replace the traditional — and quite environmentally detrimental — wood burning stoves that proliferate across low income areas of India.An electrical engineer by training with a Ph.D. from Stanford University, Sailesh’s background in technology includes stints at both AT&T Bell Labs and Intel, where he was instrumental in developing early iterations of the internet itself.Sailesh is also the author of Carbon Dharma: The Occupation of the Butterflies*— a call to undo the planetary damage done by the human species in its present “caterpillar stage” of existence.As for palmares, Sailesh was selected as a Karmaveer Puraskaar Noble Laureate, an award presented by iCONGO (Indian Confederation of NGOs) whose primary mission is to encourage citizen action for social justice.This is a conversation about environmental preservation, the inherent and incredible power of ahimsa, the imperative of service and a reminder that each and every one of can make a positive difference in the world.Sailesh is a highly intelligent, contemplative and compassionate man devoted to making the world a better, cleaner place for us and future generations. I greatly enjoyed this conversation and applaud his advocacy and devotion to service.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Note: Apologies for publishing this episode a day late and for the brevity of this post.

October 11, 2015

“I expect this [cooling glove] will be either everywhere in pro sports in a couple of years or banned.”Jason Snell – tech columnist on the RTX Cooling GloveImagine a product that could eradicate muscle fatigue in just minutes. Allow you to train substantially harder and recover exponentially faster. Maximize your training efficiency while significantly boosting strength, endurance and overall athletic performance.Sound too good to be true? Definitely. At least without failing a drug test.Now what if I told you it’s neither a drug nor illegal.Impossible?First let’s backup. One of (if not the) biggest limiters in athletic performance is elevated core temperature. Exertion causes muscle cells to heat up. Via a process called arteriovenous anastomoses, the body does its best to dissipate this extra heat. But if you continue to push yourself, core temperature will continue to rise, compromising the effectiveness of a heat sensitive enzyme crucial for energy production called pyruvate kinase. The result? Weakness, fatigue and cramping.If one could prevent the escalation of core temperature, it reasons that one could extend energy production and delay fatigue.The study of thermoregulation in the performance and recovery context is hardly new. Athletes have been experimenting with cryotherapy, ice packs, ice baths and ice vests for decades. The problem with most of these techniques is that they just don’t work all that well. It has to do with something called vasoconstriction. Overwhelming cold causes blood vessels to constrict, slowing cool blood flow to the core and thus undermining elevated core temperature reduction.Enter The Glove — an apparent solution to core temperature thermoregulation without all that pesky vasoconstriction courtesy of a team of large brains led by today’s guest — Stanford physiology and biology professor Craig Heller (and his colleague David Grahn).Essentially a plastic hand enclosure attached to a pump that circulates cool water across the palm’s special network of radiator-like heat-transfer veins that specialize in something called rapid thermal exchange (RTX), the glove overcomes the vasoconstriction dilemma by strictly regulating the temperature of the cool water (cool but not too cool) and by creating a slight vacuum around the hand that keeps the blood vessels open. Cool blood then gets distributed directly to the core organs most in need of relief, allowing the body to chill out and the muscles to keep producing energy.Early studies show promise. Positive anecdotal stories are many. A seasoned gym rat and friend of Heller’s lab increased his pull-up maximum from 180 to over 620 in less than six weeks by utilizing the glove in between sets. The result seems to neutralize muscle fatigue by cooling core temperature, allowing the subject to push himself or herself harder each workout, resulting in quantum improvement realized in a fraction of the time.Heller deems the rate of improvement unprecedented, exceeding gains expected via steroid use.Maybe. Maybe not. Who knows. I don’t. But I do know that industrial versions of the product are already being used by a litany of college & NFL football programs; the NHL’s Toronto Maple Leafs: USA Olympic team programs like men’s beach volleyball and speed skating; the Nike Oregon Project running team; and perhaps most notably, the 2014 FIFA World Cup Champion German soccer team used the glove throughout training and World Cup competition.Disclaimer: I have zero professional or financial affiliation with AVAcore (the company behind the glove) or Professor Heller (aside for the fact that he was my human biology professor in 1986). In fact, I’ve never even tried the technology (although I want to). I heard about it and reached out to professor Heller to learn more. He obliged me. This podcast is the result. That’s it.Of course, this conversation explores the impact of thermoregulation on human physiology, athletic performance and recovery. It surveys how emerging technologies are helping athletes excel beyond previously imagined capabilities. But perhaps most compelling is a pondering of the practical and philosophical implications of such performance enhancing developments on the future of fair sport.Where do you draw the line between fair play and unfair performance enhancing advantage? I’d love to hear all about it in the comments section below.I sincerely hope you enjoy this most interesting exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

A self-made guy who scraped his way from nothing to launch and manage major musical acts, found and run a successful indie label and even serve up president duties at a major record label.All of these things are very impressive and interesting.None of these things are what draw me to Jeff.Jeff is on the show because of his compelling, at times heart-wrenching but incredibly human life story. From his abusive childhood to his struggles with alcohol to the devastating loss of his six-year-old son Pablo to cancer, Jeff is a survivor. A guy who refused to let unbearable pain destroy him, instead leveraging it to access a deeper personal truth, inner strength and sense of purpose.Finding life-saving comfort and solace in both music and cycling as far back as he can remember, Jeff successfully channelled his incredible passion for both into creating a life and legacy of meaning in selfless service to others as an entrepreneur, husband, father and philanthropist.In his most recent post as president of Elektra Records, a division of Warner Music Group, Jeff worked alongside the likes of Ed Sheeran, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Kitten, bringing in acts like Fitz and the Tantrums, Saint Motel, The Moth & The Flame and Kaleo.Prior to his post at Elektra, Jeff served as CEO of Dangerbird Records, which he co-founded in 2003. There, he played a key role in the careers of Silversun Pickups, Fitz and The Tantrums and Liam Gallagher’s post-Oasis effort, Beady Eye.In 2009 Jeff & his wife Joanne Thraikill tragically lost their son Pablo to cancer just six days after his sixth birthday. From the moment of Pablo’s 2008 diagnosis with bilateral Wilms Tumor, a rare form of childhood cancer, Jeff took to the blogosphere to keep friends and family apprised of developments. Sharing his incomprehensible pain with a bold and raw vulnerability, PABLOG! went viral, resulting in a massive and unexpected outpouring of love and support for Pablo and the Castelaz / Thraikill family. Support Jeff and Joanne ultimately channelled into what would become the Pablove Foundation— a pediatric cancer charity which has raised $10 million to date in support of innovative pediatric cancer research and programs for kids and families living with childhood cancer.Each year since its inception, Pablove hosts a charity ride called Pablove Across America. Today — Monday October 5, 2015 — marks the start of Pablove’s seventh annual week-long cycling event in which 40 cyclists will ride from Los Angeles to San Francisco to raise funds and awareness for childhood cancer.

Learning how to heal. Growing up, self-care and sobriety. It’s about hope, family, redemption and service. It’s about salvation. And it’s about the beauty, comfort and agony that comes with loving wide and loving deep.Jeff is an incredibly charismatic guy with a infectious energy and a spirit the size of Montana. I’m proud to call him friend. And I’m proud to share this conversation with you today. May it move you as deeply as it moved me.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

“Our whole idea was to present [the vegan] lifestyle in an aspirational and modern way. We want to present it in a way that looks appealing, as opposed to deprivation-oriented.”Rich Roll in “Vegans Go Glam” – NY Times 9.30.15A while back I fired off this missive:Admittedly, the tweet was inspired by a little low grade frustration at utterly failing to generate any mainstream national press interest whatsoever in our book The Plantpower Way, which had recently come out. A self-reminder that you can’t push buttons and expect a pat on the back.Fast forward three months to today’s publication of Vegans Go Glam in The New York Times (The New York Times!) — a very large profile on our family and the growing vegan scene in Los Angeles and New York deftly penned by Jeff Gordinier. It’s a big article (like, really big) in perhaps the most respected mainstream publication on the planet (do I even need to say that?). It’s also an article that has kicked up some dust, generating lively discussion around the global water cooler. So much discussion in fact, Vegans Go Glam is the #1 most e-mailed story on the entire New York Times website today.“Vegans Go Glam” by Jeff Gordinier (photo by Amy Dickerson) for the New York TimesLittle Jaya just owning the New York Times homepage lead.C’mon! Now, that is just insane.So what does it all mean? That’s for you to decide, not me.

September 27, 2015

“If you’re a professional athlete, and after the game you’re eating at the same place that somebody in the audience is eating at? You’re making a mistake.”John SalleyIt’s one thing when a skinny runner dude starts talking about the benefits of a plant-based diet.It’s another thing altogether when a 6′ 11″ 4-time NBA Champion tells you it’s a good idea.Enter John Salley.Husband, father, athlete, actor, entrepreneur, talk show host, philanthropist, wellness advocate, NBA champion… and vegan.John was the first basketball player in NBA history to win four championships with three different teams in three different decades — two with the Detroit Pistons (’89 & ’90), one with the Chicago Bulls (’96) & one more with the Los Angeles Lakers (’00). After eleven seasons he retired as a Laker on the 2000 NBA Lakers Championship team. Since his retirement from the NBA, John has worked consistently in television, film, radio, print and new media. For seven years he co-hosted the Emmy-nominated series The Best Damn Sports Show Period (FOX). He then hosted BET’s sports talk show Baller before creating his own show Game On for REELZ. In addition, John is an avid entrepreneur, channeling his enthusiasm for clean eating & advocacy for the vegan lifestyle into an array of ventures, including The Vegan Vine, his California wine brand (who knew some wine wasn’t vegan?), and his Betta Life 21-Day Challenge.John’s mission is simple: to educate as many people as possible on the health and environmental benefits of a plant-based lifestyle.This is a fairly free range conversation that takes us inside John’s NBA career; what it was like to play ball at the highest level with guys like Michael Jordan, Isaiah Thomas and Shaq; and how being coached by Phil Jackson, perhaps the greatest coach in basketball history, helped forge his character and inform his post-NBA career success.We get into the hows and whys of John’s decision to go vegan; his opinion on how most professional athletes eat; why so many professional athletes die young; how he works with both athletes and average folks to change misplaced, normative ideas about the plant-based lifestyle; the importance of yoga and meditation in his routine; and what drives his mission to change the face of global health. A few more topics covered include:John is an easy guy to love. He is engaging, incredibly charismatic and always entertaining. But behind the playful attitude is a serious message worth heeding.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

September 23, 2015

“It’s not about finding peace, it’s about being at peace with what we find.”Jason GarnerImagine yourself a top executive at the very apex of the music industry food chain. Your job requires you to travel the world first class and wine and dine the biggest musical acts on the planet like Jay Z, Beyoncé, Coldplay and John Mayer. And you’re making so much cash, you’ve twice been named to Fortune magazine’s annual list of the top 20 highest paid executives under 40.Now imagine walking away from it all. Why? Raised by a single mom in a series of unstable living situations, Jason Garner learned early and often how to look after himself. With street-wise hustle and natural salesmanship, he worked hard in school and later even harder in business.Scrapping his way from a weekend job at a flea market to owning his own concert company, by the time he was 37 Jason had become CEO of Global Music at Live Nation Entertainment — the world’s largest concert promotion company and arguably the most important corporate entity in the entire music industry.It can safely be said he made it.Unfortunately, never once did Jason pause to take a breath. Operating on the misplaced belief that in order to be loved, he had to be the best, Jason would have happily pursued his career path all the way to the grave.But then something happened. Something that would change everything.In the wake of his second divorce, the single mom that was Jason’s everything contracted stomach cancer. Her sudden death brought his life to a halt and his ego to its knees. Compelled to re-evaluate his life top to bottom, Jason finally asked himself a most important question:what really matters?To answer this, Jason did the unthinkable for someone in his exalted executive position: he quit his job.And for the first time in his life, Jason actually breathed.For the next several years, he immersed himself in the study and practice of health and spirituality. He got to know himself and the inner-workings of his mind. And he met the woman of his dreams.Today he is both student and teacher of all things spiritual, mindful and meditative. A man who has spent literally thousands of hours sitting cross-legged with Masters of body, mind and spirit. A journey to wholeness that has left Jason far happier and more personally fulfilled than he ever was in his envious capacity as a prestigious CEO in perhaps the sexiest business in the world.Jason shares his fantastic voyage to self-love and self-acceptance — from living for matter to living to matter — in his quite compelling memoir … And Then I Breathed: My Journey from a Life of Matter to a Life That Matters*. Plenty of further insights can be found on his thought provoking blog at jasongarner.com.Jason is a beautiful, special soul. His courage, commitment and warmth (he signs all his e-mails with “Big Hugs”) inspires me to do and be better. It was an honor to sit in his vibration and I’m proud to share this conversation. A conversation that traverses the elegant arc of Jason’s life with a focus on all things meditation & mindfulness, including:Today’s question: Are you living life “for matter” or “to matter”?I’d love to hear all about it in the comments section below.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

380,William MacAskill,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/william-macaskill/,"Episode 178
September 20, 2015

“The challenge for us is this: How can we ensure that, when we try to help others, we do so as effectively as possible?”William MacAskillMost of us want to do good.We devote our precious time to causes we deem worthy. We donate our precious funds to charities that appear to make a difference. We pursue careers we consider meaningful, and patronize businesses and buy products we believe make the world a better place.Unfortunately, we often base these decisions on assumptions and emotions rather than facts. As a result, even our best intentions often lead to ineffective—and sometimes downright harmful—outcomes.So how can we do better?In an effort to determine a career personally optimized for maximum positive impact, Professor William MacAskill began to ask himself this very question.  While a young researcher at Oxford, he discovered that much of the potential for change was being squandered by lack of information, bad data, and our own prejudice. As an antidote, he and his colleagues developed a modality of thought that would later birth the movement known today as effective altruism: a practical, data-driven approach to “doing good” that proffers the best options to make a tremendous positive difference.In other words, “doing good” (or a well-intentioned act aimed at doing good) is not enough.We must do good better.William is a 28-year old Scottish born scholar and author who is associate professor of Philosophy at Lincoln College Oxford. Previous to this chair, William was a research fellow in philosophy from Emanuel College at Cambridge and a Fullbright scholar at Princeton.If all of this still fails to impress, while still in his twenties (because after all he is still in his twenties), William co-founded 2 successful non-profits, which combined have raised over $400 million in lifetime pledged donations to charity and helped to spark the effective altruism movement:Walking his talk, William has officially pledged to donate any and all earned income in excess of $35K USD to such effective charities. This makes for a very interesting line of questioning during today’s conversation.William shares his ideas — some of which are controversial and at times iconoclastic — as a contributor to The Atlantic and in several prominent international publications (see below show notes) and he and his organizations have been featured in The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, NPR, and TED, among other media outlets.Although William lives in Oxford, I was able to sit down with him in Silicon Valley a few weeks ago as his noon-profit 80000hours.org was one of the very first non-profits ever invited to participate in the highly prestigious accelerator program hosted by prominent seed venture fund Y Combinator. For context, this is the fund and program that launched companies like Dropbox, AirBnB, and Reddit among many others.William recently released his first book, Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help you Make a Difference*. I couldn’t put it down. It forever changed how I look at giving. And it has breathed new life into how I contemplate the most effective way I can make a positive difference in the world I will someday leave behind.This is a pretty intense and at times heady conversation that covers a lot of ground, including:William is an exceedingly bright and incredibly impressive young man. It was an honor and a pleasure to probe his philosophical mind. A conversation that left me wondering just what the world would look like if everyone heeded William’s call and committed to an effective altruistic path.How can you do good better? I’d love to hear about it in the comments section below.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

381,Kevin Breel,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/kevin-breel-depression/,"Episode 177
September 16, 2015

“The world I believe in is one where embracing your light doesn’t mean ignoring the dark.”Kevin BreelLet’s talk about depression.Kevin Breel didn’t fit the adolescent persona you would expect to fall prey to this debilitating affliction. One of the popular kids in high school, he was team captain of his standout basketball team. A class clown who would later pursue a career in stand up comedy. The guy who could hold court around the party keg and always keep everyone else laughing. Everyone except himself.At the time, Kevin was leading a clandestine double life. A dark secret he kept well hidden behind his well attuned comedic timing. A confusing and dire mental state that would leave him bedridden and secluded in isolation for days on end. A fatal secret that culminated in a suicide attempt that nearly took his young life.What prevented Kevin from sharing his pain and reaching out for help when he needed it most?The stigma that still surrounds a mental disease that lurks in the shadows, feeds on isolation and goes unchecked due to profound misunderstanding and misplaced judgment.You might be shocked to hear that according to Save.org, depression is the 2nd leading cause of death for young Americans between the ages of 15-24. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression impacts 121 million people across the globe and is the leading cause of disability worldwide, claiming 800,000 lives annually. That’s one death by depression-induced suicide every 40 seconds.Luckily, Kevin found a way out. A solution that began with the courage to directly confront his pain.It was a move that not only saved his life, but gave him newfound purpose — a quest to shatter the profound yet unwarranted stigma that surrounds his disease by becoming an ambassador of hope to teens everywhere that they need not suffer in silence.The message? That by embracing the darkness within and bringing it into the light, together we can heal.At age 19, Kevin reared his gangly 6’3″ frame atop a stage in a small nondescript auditorium to share his story publicly for the first time. The circumstance? A local TEDx event in Ambleside, a quiet neighborhood in southwest Edmonton, Alberta. Hardly an illustrious venue, he looked out upon a small crowd of no more than 80 and thought, I’ll be lucky if more than a couple hundred people ultimately watch this when it goes online.What happened next was astonishing.Lauded for its immediacy, raw honesty, unbridled emotion and authentic vulnerability, Confessions of a Depressed Comic struck a universal cultural nerve and became an instant viral hit. Collecting over half a million views in it’s first 30 days, it now clocks well over 3 million views, making it one of the most watched TED Talks of all time. Featured on more than 200+ media outlets, Mashable called it “one of the moments that brought the world together.”A 15-minute speech that forever altered the trajectory of Kevin’s life.Today Kevin is an internationally recognized mental health activist. A large personality exuding warmth and humor channeled around topics people tend not to talk about, Kevin has become an in demand guest speaker at over 100 colleges and universities across North America, frequently sharing the stage with Governors, professional athletes and celebrities. He has written opinion pieces for major media and his work has been featured by The Huffington Post, MTV, CNN, The TODAY Show on NBC, Mashable and The Wall Street Journal. Not enough? Kevin has also personally aided in raising millions of dollars in mental health fundraising,This week marks the release of his first book, Boy Meets Depression: Or Life Sucks and Then You Live*— a bumpy and brutally honest memoir that explores his battle with depression and illuminates how the real challenge in life isn’t trying to be perfect, it’s accepting the dark parts of ourselves. It’s a great read I highly suggest you check it out.Today’s story is a cautionary tale. But it’s also a story of hope and redemption. A conversation that covers a lot of ground, including:Kevin is a super cool kid, amongst the best of his Millennial peers. It was a pleasure getting to know him and I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Question of the Week: Does someone in your life suffer from depression?

September 13, 2015

“[Animal agriculture] is one of the largest industries on the planet, with the biggest environmental impact. And they are trying to keep us in the dark about how they are operating…”Will Potter, independent journalist & TED Senior FellowA little over a year ago, I shared an amazing conversation with Kip Andersen & Keegan Kuhn, the dynamic filmmaking duo behind Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret. If you missed that episode, I encourage you to check it out here— it’s one of my most popular episodes to date.An Inconvenient Truth meets Blackfish, Cowspiracy is an incredibly sobering and powerful (yet also funny and entertaining) documentary that takes a hard, unflinching look at the incredibly negative impact of animal agriculture on the health, well being and sustainability of our planet and it’s precious, dwindling resources.Whether we are talking about carbon emissions, climate change, the blindingly rapid destruction of our rain forests, over consumption of water, species extinction, the depletion and destruction of our soil, the pollution of our rivers, lakes and oceans or the obliteration of natural wildlife habitats, you might be surprised to discover the very inconvenient and uncomfortable truth that animal agriculture is the industry by far most responsible for the global environmental catastrophe we currently face.If this is true, then why aren’t we talking about it more?Cowspiracy is the rather shocking tale of what Kip and Keegan discovered trying to answer this very question.The little indie film that could, Cowspiracy is a true grassroots phenomenon. Crowd-source funded, rejected by the film festival circuit and lacking distribution, Kip and Keegan spent the last year traveling the country in a van attending independently organized, homespun screenings. Getting the word out one screen at a time, one audience at a time.Then something truly amazing happened. The film fell into the hands of Leonardo DiCaprio. The biggest movie star in the world didn’t just fall in love with the movie, he came on board as Executive Producer with a mission: that Cowspiracy become required viewing for everyone and anyone who gives a slightest damn about the health of our planet.This week that mission moves towards reality. On Tuesday, September 15, Cowspiracy will premiere on Netflix worldwide. For those of you that have already seen the film, this is a new and improved cut — tighter with updated facts, it demands another view.The impact of Leonardo’s name and credibility on the film’s reach is astronomical and cannot be overstated. I am extremely proud to be an early supporter and associate producer on this project. I’m excited for mainstream audiences to finally discover this important film. I’m over the moon that Kip and Keegan will now be recognized on a mass level for their incredible work.But mostly I am excited for the dynamic environmental conversation that will inevitably ensue. And the positive changes to follow.Picking up where our first conversation left off, today’s podcast covers a lot of ground, including:Kip and Keegan are truly breaking paradigms. Making the world a better place. And changing lives with what I think is the most important film of the year.I aspire to their level of courage and advocacy. And I sincerely hope you enjoy this exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

September 9, 2015

“The search for the authentic self is the essence of recovery.”Adam SudI love the everyman stories.Adam Sud isn’t famous. He’s not a world-class performer. And he’s not schilling a book.He’s just an average dude living a pretty normal life.But look deeper and you’ll find a rather extraordinary story. The story of a guy who completely lost himself in the bleak darkness of drug and food addiction. Hopelessly hooked since high school on the superman rush provided by Adderall, Adam spent most of his twenties isolating and high — up all night playing video games and binging on fast food.The heavier he got, the more he isolated, until he stopped caring altogether. Life shrank to a cycle of getting high, finding more Adderall, and repressing his increased depression and anger with more and more fast food — a lifestyle that left him over 300lbs with Type-2 diabetes on a crash course with an early grave. Out of cash, unemployable and alienated from friends and family, Adam finally faced a choice:live on the street or reach out for help.After extended stays in rehab and sober living facilities Adam found sobriety, peace of mind and a new lease on life.Oh yeah — he also lost over 100 pounds, reversed his diabetes and repaired his physical health wholesale. How?By adopting an active, plant-based lifestyle.Today, Adam lives a conscious, purpose-driven life devoted to helping others achieve and maintain a holistic, healthy lifestyle.Not surprisingly, this is a conversation about drug addiction, sobriety and nutrition. But it’s also a conversation about cross-addiction, low self-esteem and an important issue rarely discussed — body dysmorphia and eating disorders in men.I’m inspired by Adam’s tale of everyman redemption and I think you will be too.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

September 6, 2015

“Success is defined not by how many cars you have or any of that nonsense but rather by how much of your day you spend doing something you really hate doing.”Casey NeistatToday marks my third conversation with the singular Casey Neistat.Does a guy who has amassed over 100 million total views on his YouTube Channel — not to mention 1 million views daily —  really need a formal introduction? Unlikely. But if for some reason this exciting filmmaker has eclipsed your radar, you can read my in depth thoughts on his extraordinary life and listen to our prior conversations HERE (RRP #73) and HERE (RRP #144).If you’re well on board the Casey train, you’ve witnessed quite an evolution in his recent trajectory. Since Casey began daily vlogging — posting a new movie on his YouTube Channel every single day since March 27, 2015 — his already incredibly popular YouTube Channel has exploded, growing from around 500,000 subscribers to well over 1.1 million in less than five months. On average, each vlog amasses around 500,000 views. This one tops out at 1.5 million (which incidentally has absolutely nothing to do with what occurs at the 4-minute mark):A major network television show would kill for these numbers. But Casey has no interest in such matters. He’s not making videos to capture the interest of the system he consciously placed in his rear view. For Casey, YouTube is the finish line — a juggernaut channel he built all by himself. DIY on the most democratic video platform in the world. And that is far more powerful and compelling than anything HBO, NBC, Disney or any other traditional mainstream outlet could ever offer him. Ever.If you’re not yet hip to his channel, get on it. A unique voice delivered with expert filmmaking acuity, each and every movie hooks you emotionally and never fails to captivate. His movies are so popular in fact, crowds of people congregate daily outside his downtown New York City studio, pining for a mere glimpse of the populist artist.And now thanks to the new social media video sharing platform he co-founded called Beme, Casey can add technology entrepreneur to his expanding resume.Intended to change how we view and use social media, Beme allows users to post successive 4-second video snippets without the opportunity to preview, review or even view the clips before they publish. By altogether dispensing with the opportunity to edit and filter, the big idea is to promote honesty, authenticity and ultimately empathy through shared experience. Rather than sharing the well crafted and highly filtered version of ourselves we want the world to see, Beme is about sharing our point of view the way we actually experience it.Casey was nice enough to invite me to be a Beme beta tester, and I have been having a lot of fun with it. Download the app for free and follow me at richroll and Casey at casey. In any event, when my daughter Mathis & I dropped by Casey’s epic studio this past July, Beme had not yet launched and was then still top secret. Therefore, I was unfortunately unable to explore the most exciting and relevant aspect of Casey’s current life in this podcast. But no worries — there is always so much to mine from Casey and this conversation does not disappoint.I love this guy. I admire his determination. I applaud his positive message. I’m in awe of his creative output. And I celebrate his commitment to promting empathy by providing us with new tools to share our lives more honestly and authentically.Today’s conversation spans:I’ll leave you with one of my favorite Casey vlogs, mainly because I think it captures his ethos and filmmaking perspective quite nicely.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Happiness is not a choice. It’s a byproduct of building and cultivating an inner strength so you can ‘be happy’ effortlessly — and without thought.”Light WatkinsI want to be happy. Everybody wants to be happy.So why is it so hard to just be happy?Many self-help gurus present happiness as a choice. The idea that happiness can be produced whenever we want, irrespective of circumstance. Simply learn to flick a certain mental switch and voila!It’s an intoxicating idea. But is this axiom actually true?Meet Light Watkins.Friend, teacher and expert on mindfulness and meditation, Light proffers some interesting and perhaps somewhat controversial counterpoint perspectives on a question that deeply concerns all of us: how to best cultivate happiness?First, let’s get the obvious out of the way. Beyond his beguiling good looks, Light Watkins is pretty much the coolest name ever. Right?On a more earnest note, I would characterize Light as a generous, highly accessible and contemplative entrepreneur of mindfulness — always convivial, impressively composed, and quick with a laugh. He has been operating in the meditation space for over 15 years and has been teaching Vedic Meditation since 2003. He’s personally taught nearly 2,000 people to meditate, including bankers, artists, politicians, CEOs, care takers, educators, comedians, rock stars, students, and seekers of all kinds. He is the author of The Inner Gym: A 30-day Workout for Strengthening Happiness*, a frequent blogger, TEDx speaker and founder of The Shine Movement. A mashup of TED, Hotel Café & The Self-Realization Fellowship, The Shine is an all volunteer organization that hosts periodic gatherings that use music, film, philanthropy and storytelling to inspire people to do more, give more, and be more.We cover a lot of ground in this conversation, including:Light inspires me.

“The only way to succeed is to fail… over & over & over again. Just get right in your head with failing; that’s how you succeed.”Mishka ShubalyIf you’re a long-time listener of the podcast, then you’ve treated yourself to several of my conversations with today’s guest. You know this guy well as my gravelly voiced, eminently talented, always charming yet generally disheveled, periodically homeless co-host — now back for a record 6th appearance on the RRP.Mishka Shubaly doesn’t care much for formalities. But if you need a resumé, his goes something like this:A self-professed povertarian, Mishka writes true stories about drink, drugs, disasters, desire, deception, and their aftermath. He began drinking at 13 and college at 15. At 22, he received the Dean’s Fellowship from the Master’s Writing Program at Columbia University. Upon receiving his expensive MFA, he promptly moved into a Toyota minivan to tour the country nonstop as a singer-songwriter, sharing the stage with artists like The Strokes, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs and The Decemberists.At 32, Mishka got sober and shortly thereafter began publishing a string of bestselling Kindle Singles – short non-fiction novellas — through Amazon. His writing has been praised for its grit, humor, fearlessness, and heart. The Long Run*, his mini-memoir detailing his transformation from alcoholic drug abuser to sober ultra-runner is one of the best-selling Kindle Singles in Amazon history.Mishka’s third solo album, Coward’s Path — the finest set of miserable and sad songs you might ever hear— will be released on October 2, 2015. His new book, I Swear I’ll Make It Up To You: A Life on the Low Road* hits bookstores March 8, 2016.If you’re new to this podcast, dig the Mishka vibe and want to hear more, check out RRP episodes 27, 31, 65, 95 & 104. That’s about 9 hours of Mishka to keep you busy.Otherwise, I hope you enjoy this peek into the complicated, curious, fascinating and always entertaining mind of one of my best friends. I say this everytime I post a podcast with Mishka, because it’s always true: I’m fairly certain this is our best conversation to date.

388,Conrad Anker,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/conrad-anker/,"Episode 170
August 23, 2015

“Enlightenment isn’t found on a full stomach, or on a soft pillow.”Conrad AnkerImagine bivouacking in a portaledge — you and two other guys crammed into a small mountaineering tent pitched vertically and dangling on the side of a sheer Himalayan cliff 19,000 feet above solid ground with nothing but nothing below you. Then imagine staying put for 12 days straight to weather a ferocious storm, torrential winds and temperatures that dip into twenty below territory.That’s just one harrowing peek into the life of today’s guest, Conrad Anker – a man widely considered to be the most accomplished high altitude climber in the world and one of the most respected adventure athletes of all time.The team leader of The North Face climbing team as well as the subject of not one but several Outside Magazine cover profiles, Conrad is renown for specializing in not just the highest mountains but the most technically challenging ascents — conquering the trickiest peaks spread across the high Himalaya, Antarctica, Alaska and the big walls of Patagonia.Conrad has summited Everest 3 times, including a successful 2012 ascent without the aid of supplemental oxygen — a feat reserved for only the most elite mountaineers. In a 1999 Everest expedition, Conrad famously located the remains of George Mallory— the legendary British climber who disappeared in the midst of his historic 1924 attempt to be the first to summit the world’s highest peak. Last seen about 800 vertical feet from the summit, speculation as to whether Mallory and his climbing partner Andrew Irvine had reached the summit before dying has been a subject of much dispute. But Conrad’s discovery shed much light on the mystery of this and other pioneering climbs of early expeditions.On a personal level, in 1999 Conrad survived an avalanche in Tibet — a massive wall of snow and ice that tossed his body 100 feet, beat him up badly and took the life of his best friend and climbing companion Alex Lowe. Conrad would later marry Alex’s widow Jennifer and raise his three sons, Max, Sam and Isaac.A few years ago I had the good fortune of meeting Conrad, including the privilege of hearing him share the story of his internationally celebrated 2011 attempt to summit a peak previously thought impossible – the Shark’s Fin of Meru. Considered the most technically complicated and dangerous peak in the Himalayas, it’s an astonishing tale.Now this expedition is the subject of a new documentary aptly named Meru, feted with the prestigious Audience Award at last winter’s Sundance Film Festival. I had an opportunity to see the film and I can say first hand that it is extraordinary. Visceral. Harrowing. And terrifying as much as it is inspiring. “A meditation on life, death and everything in between” according to Newsweek, the film works as a true character study, winning mainstream hearts previously unfamiliar with the world of climbing. A redemptive deep look into the lives and complicated pasts of Conrad and his talented climbing teammates Jimmy Chin and Renan Ozturk (both responsible for not only scaling the peak but also capturing the entire experience on film), it’s a contemplation on tragedy. It’s about family, friendship and risk. And it’s a film about the redemptive power of suffering nature’s harshest elements to achieve the extraordinary.Not only a mountaineering savant, Conrad is also a passionate environmentalist. An exemplary ambassador of adventure, sport and the outdoors. A deeply grounded and humble man, mindful and profoundly connected to nature.Today I sit down with Conrad to explore the many facets of his most remarkable life, including:A beautiful man, I’m proud to call Conrad friend. And I’m beyond excited to share his story with you today.Special thanks to Jimmy Chin for graciously allowing me use of his amazing photography in today’s podcast.

August 16, 2015

“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”Marcus AureliusI love talking to smart people. Today’s guest is certainly that — and so much more.Contravening millennial stereotypes, Ryan Holiday is a prolific, rising literary talent. A maverick media strategist. Not to mention a philosopher of sorts — a guy with big ideas often at odds with the status quo.An autodidact, Ryan dropped out of college at nineteen to apprentice under acclaimed author Robert Greene, author of (among many other great books) The 48 Laws of Power*, later graduating to advise many New York Times bestselling authors like Tim Ferriss and RRP #154 alum Tucker Max, multiplatinum musicians like Linkin Park and startups like Casey Neistat’s ( RRP 73 & RRP 144 ) recently launched social media platform Beme.By the time he was legally allowed to drink (21!) Ryan had already ascended to director of marketing duties at American Apparel, where his iconoclastic campaigns and tactics have been used as case studies by Twitter, YouTube, and Google and written about in places like AdAge, the New York Times, and Fast Company.Ryan is also the bestselling author of 3 books, including Trust Me I’m Lying* – a highly entertaining and admittedly disturbing first hand look at the machinations behind digital media’s dark underbelly — and The Obstacle Is The Way* – a modern and practical reframing of stoicism, the ancient Roman philosophy originated by guys like Marcus Aurelius, Seneca and Epictetus, with a focus on functional applicability of stoic principles for turning modern day obstacles into opportunities and adversity to advantage.If you think philosophy is purely academic — a useless waste of time reserved for the arrogant intellectual elite — Ryan has a message for you:think again.I really love this book. I found it to be eminently practical. An incredibly insightful and utilitarian tool box for navigating crises, strengthening character and maximizing excellence in any situation, irrespective of circumstance.On RyanHoliday.net and places like Thought Catalog and Observer (where he is editor at large), Ryan writes frequently on a wide variety of business and marketing related subject matters. But it’s his fresh and unique take on real life stuff that keeps me coming back.A voracious reader, I highly suggest everyone subscribe to Ryan’s monthly reading recommendation newsletter of books he’s read, reviewed and thinks you will like. It’s great.This is a really interesting conversation about many things, not the least of which is Ryan’s perspective on stoicism as a primer for conceptualizing, confronting and ultimately overcoming whatever scenario befalls you. It’s a conversation about our collective misunderstanding when it comes to the importance of the struggle as gift — the importance of the journey beyond the success equation as formative of character and self-esteem. It’s about doable strategies for overcoming the barriers that too often hold us back. And it’s about reconciling the fundamental principles of stoicism with our misguided inclination to short cut — aka ‘hack’ — our way to a fulfilling and sustainable result.Plus, we take an interesting dive into the machinations of modern marketing culture in our click bait obsessed, shadenfreude-infused, internet shaming world, including parameters for discerning the internet snake oil salesman from the valuable content provider.All told, this conversation explores:I sincerely hope you enjoy our discussion.How can stoicism help you navigate personal and professional obstacles?

392,"James ""Iron Cowboy"" Lawrence",https://www.richroll.com/podcast/iron-cowboy-2/,"Episode 166
August 9, 2015

“Just be empowered to do that hard thing in your life…however low you are, wherever you are, there’s someone out there that loves you and there’s someone out there that can support you and there’s a way to climb out of it.”James “Iron Cowboy” LawrenceI’m exploding with excitement about this week’s hotly anticipated show.Today I sit down with James Lawrence — aka The Iron Cowboy — fresh on the heels of completing an absolutely unprecedented and mind-boggling 50 ironman-distance triathlons in 50 states in just 50 days.I honestly believe this is one of the greatest achievements in the history of (voluntary) human endurance.For the uninitiated, consider swimming 2.4 miles, pedaling your bike 112 miles and then running a marathon, 26.2 miles. After quickly eating and bathing, you enjoy anywhere from two to four hours of shut eye, usually in the back of a Subaru as it drives through the night to meet dawn in an adjoining state. Then you heave your weary bones up, eat, get dressed and do it all over again. Every single day. 50 days in row, across each and every one of the 50 states — including Hawaii and Alaska — without one single day off.Just think about that for a moment. Let it sink in.During James’ initial appearance on the podcast (RRP 149) just prior to his 50/50/50 attempt, I went on record here and on various media outlets like Triathlete.com voicing my concern that James just might have aimed a bit too high.As someone who did 5 ironman-distance triathlons in a row on each of the 5 Hawaiian Islands, I happen to have a little experience in this arena. Admittedly my accomplishments now seem paltry (almost embarrassing) by comparison, the fact remains that I happen to be one of the few people on the planet who can truly understand, appreciate and deeply empathize with the abyss James would inevitably face, battle, endure and be forced to overcome in order to complete his extraordinary journey intact.I know what it’s like to meet unforeseen obstacles that threaten to imperil the mission. I know what it’s like to fall asleep on your bike. I know what it’s like to have saddle sores so painful you can’t sit down. I know what it’s like to run through the night, hallucinating. And I know what it’s like when that inevitable moment arises and you ask yourself: what am I doing to myself?But James and his entire family were all in from the get go. To underwrite the endeavor, they even sold their house and put all their earthly possessions in storage. So never for a second did I doubt his level of commitment. I knew he could complete 50 ironman-distance triathlons in 50 states. It was the 50 days part that bent my brain. Certainly he’ll have to take at least one day off, right? Maybe two. In my mind, I predicted at least three intermittent rest days.James, you proved me wrong. You proved the world wrong.And I couldn’t be happier. Or more proud. It’s not just that you did what you said you would do. It’s the way you did it. It was your composure. It was you tremendous grace under fire. Your selflessness in service to a greater cause. All fueled by an attitude of gratitude.On a last minute whim, I decided to show up unannounced in Utah to surprise James, join him on his final marathon jaunt, and witness the conclusion first hand. An experience I will never forget, it was thrilling and emotional to be running just off his shoulder as he crossed his historic finish line, accomplished his goal, embraced his family and raised his fist in victory to the deafening cheers of 3,600 fans in solidarity. Like a boss. Like Maximus in ‘Gladiator’.Enjoy my video surprising James on the final day plus some podcast behind the scenes:What made the whole affair even more special is that it did not play out under the klieg lights of national television, but rather in relative initial obscurity. But as word began to slowly spread across the tentacles of social media, a true grass roots movement of community support gradually emerged. Interest grew, luring an exponential increase in attention with each successive day. By the time James’ reached his Utah apogee, hundreds of thousands of people — most of which had zero previous interest in triathlon — had become enraptured by the unfolding drama, starting each morning by logging in to the Iron Cowboy Facebook Page with just one question in mind:Is he still alive?But understand that this was no individual achievement. It was truly a team effort. In fact, James’ success is inextricably linked to the incredible support of family, friends, sponsors and the ever expanding community of people that showed up in each and every state to help him cross each consecutive finish line.Today it’s my privilege to bring to you the first comprehensive, completely uncut recap of James’ historic and extraordinary accomplishment.Not only do I get James’ first-hand observations on the whole affair, I also get his wife Sunny Jo’s perspective. I talk with his precocious eldest daughter Lucy about what it was like running the last 5K of every one of the 50 marathons in all 50 states — a remarkable achievement in it’s own right! — with her dad. I also take the temperature of James’ two primary crew chiefs, Aaron Hopkinson and Casey Robles. Aptly dubbed The Wingmen, the comedic wonder twins were essential to meeting James’ every need while simultaneously serving up much needed levity along the way.Case in point? The Wingmen showed up for the podcast in nothing but grass skirt speedoes. Plantpower!So how did this humble husband and father of five — a man who considers himself very average in terms of genetic athletic gifts — succeed in accomplishing a goal so unfathomable nobody thought it possible?Perhaps it was his impenetrable sense of self-belief. His extraordinary conviction. Or his strong core of support. I’d say all of the above.James will tell you it was 80% mental.Among other things, this conversation explores:Final note: I get emotional at the end — a first for me on this podcast. Perhaps a tribute to how much it meant to me personally to see James succeed. So there’s that to look forward to.What’s holding you back from tackling your dream? I’d love to hear about it in the comments section below.I sincerely hope you enjoy this very special conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Being grateful is the bridge between the world of nightmares and the world where we are free to say no. It’s the bridge between the world of delusions and the world of creativity. It’s the power that brings death back to life, the power that turns poverty to wealth and anger to compassion…”James AltucherI’m so intimidated.This week Julie and I are joined by the dynamic duo of the Choose Yourself era themselves, James and Claudia Altucher — a prolific couple changing the world with insights that are empowering millions to live more dynamic, authentic lives.When someone fires off a long list of occupations in conversation, my instinct tells me that person probably isn’t great at any of them. James is not that guy. Abundant in talent. A true polymath with just the right amount of self-deprecation and pitch perfect comedic timing. Blogger, bestselling author, podcaster, public speaker, investor, entrepreneur, columnist, and humorist, he seemingly does it all.Oh yeah, he’s also a nationally ranked chess master.James had made millions, lost millions and made millions again. Maybe he’ll lose it again. I don’t know. He’s started and run something like 20 companies. Then there’s a slew of venture capital, hedge, angel and sundry other funds he ran. Maybe he still runs them. I don’t know that either. In fact, I don’t understand any of it.James’ Altucher Confidential is one of the most widely read blogs on the internet, amassing over 15 million readers since its 2010 inception.The James Altucher Show debuted as the #1 podcast on all of iTunes last year.I think he’s written 13 books. It could be 16. I can’t keep track. He writes faster than I can read.My favorite is the Wall Street Journal Best Seller Choose Yourself. A primer for anyone seeking firmer control of destiny, it’s a prescient and highly entertaining look at how new and unprecedented tools, technology and economic forces have suddenly emerged to make it possible for individuals to create art, careers, success, fulfillment and change the world without permission from the gatekeepers of yore.When you finish that book, then read The Power of No — also a Wall Street Journal Best Seller. Two things you need to know about this book: (1) it’s really great; and (2) learning how and when to say no is, like, really important.Wait, there’s a third thing: it was co-authored by James’ wife Claudia.In many ways James’ perfect match, the Argentinian-born Claudia is also a widely acclaimed multi-hyphenate. Writer, podcaster and yoga aficionado, she has written or co-written three books, including the recently released Become An Idea Machine. You can find her Yoga Podcast on iTunes and read her musings at ClaudiaYoga.com. But I don’t know how much longer she can keep this up because any day now she’s going to be named the new CEO of Twitter.Am I joking? Read this and you tell me.I had James on my podcast a while ago. Then I did his podcast. Then Julie did Claudia’s podcast. They fell in love. I was already in love with James.The only thing? None of us had ever met in person. Until now.Wonder twin powers activate!I’m not sure whose podcast we did. We just hit record and started freestyling. I thought we were interviewing James and Claudia but now I think I have it all backwards.Let’s call it a crosscast.Here’s just a few of the many subjects that came up:James and Claudia are special people.

August 3, 2015

“I’ve really started to look at health as being contagious in a way that when you start to make really good and considered choices about your own well-being, the people around you take notice and they start doing the same thing as well.”Seamus MullenImagine yourself so debilitated by a battery of chronic ailments you can barely get out of bed. Merely walking down a simple flight of stairs or lifting a a book is excruciating. Knife-like pains cause you to scream so loudly, your neighbor calls 911. Then one day you collapse at work and awake in the hospital to discover you have suffered 36 embolisms that are filling your lungs with blood so quickly, drowning is a very real possibility.Now imagine yourself a couple years later in a tropical jungle competing in La Ruta Del Conquistadores. Widely considered one of the toughest endurance challenges on the planet, La Ruta is a 3-day, 161-mile mountain bike race with over 29,000 feet of climbing that traverses Costa Rica from the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea.This is the incredible arc of today’s guest, Seamus Mullen.An award-winning New York City chef, restaurateur and cookbook author known for his inventive yet approachable Spanish cuisine, Seamus is the proprietor of several restaurants, including Tertulia (a finalist for the James Beard Foundation Award for “Best New Restaurant”), El Colmado, a Spanish tapas and wine bar at Gotham West Market, and Sea Containers at Mondrian London.A semi-finalist for Best Chef NYC by the James Beard Foundation 3 years in a row, Seamus was also one of 3 finalists on the Food Network’s The Next Iron Chef. He frequents the popular Food Network series Chopped and Beat Bobby Flay as a featured judge and is a recurring guest on programs such as The Today Show, The Martha Stewart Show, and CBS This Morning.But the important things in life snapped into focus for Seamus in 2007 when he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that precipitated a near death experience and quite literally brought him to his knees.A once avid cyclist who raced competitively in his twenties, Seamus suddenly found himself unable to properly function.Pedal a bike? A pipe dream.Seamus was faced with a choice. Either live out the remainder of his days with unbearable suffering, or take matters into his own hands. He chose the latter.It wasn’t easy. And it wasn’t overnight. But by making a decision to make wellness his number one priority; by harnessing the power of holistic, functional medicine; and by rebooting his lifestyle wholesale, Seamus Mullen ultimately healed himself.By virtue of working with people like lifestyle architect Ari Meisel and functional medicine doctor and RRP alumnus Frank Lipman (click here to listen to my podcast with Frank), Seamus can now add wellness advocate and authority to his already impressive resume. And when he’s not racing his bike across Costa Rica, he’s pedaling for charity or lost on one of his many cycling and motorcycle adventures exploring remote parts of the planet.Seamus has shared his amazing story of renewal with major publications like The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and through his bi-monthly column in Men’s Journal. He is currently making a documentary about his journey called Back on the Bike.Seamus is a great guy and we had a fantastic conversation that explores all the aforementioned topics and then some, including:For the record, Seamus isn’t vegan (yet – trust me, I’m working on it). But that doesn’t mean we can’t get along, find plenty of commonalities and agree on a wide range of important issues related to health and wellness. Plus, he did prepare me and John Joseph one of the most unique and incredibly delicious 6 course vegan meals I have ever experienced in my life. So I can more than attest to his culinary genius. Next time you are in NYC, drop by Tertulia in the West Village, tell him you want The Rich Roll Special. Then snap a photo of his (I predict priceless) reaction and send it to me.I sincerely hope you listen with an open mind and enjoy the conversation.Is wellness your number one priority? If not, why not? I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

Perhaps you’ll become a person of service. It’s different for everybody.”Julie PiattWe’re back with yet another installment of Ask Me Anything, a twist on my typical long-form interview format where Julie and I engage you — the listener — by addressing the topics and questions you want discussed.As a person prone to extremes, I have been spending quite a bit of time lately pondering the importance of balance and moderation in living an optimally fulfilling life.What is the role of balance when you are pursuing your best self? Is moderation in all things truly an aspirational path?In short, I am starting to question the premise.This week Julie and I discuss this personal conundrum at length.

July 26, 2015

“The fact that [doctors] are not given the training to use what is almost universally recognized as the most powerful tool [healthy nutrition] is crazy.”Michelle McMacken, MDWe need more doctors like Michelle McMacken, MD.Board certified in internal medicine, Dr. McMacken is an assistant professor at the NYU School of Medicine, an attending primary care physician at New York City’s Bellevue Hospital Center and director of the Bellevue Adult Weight Management Clinic, where she specializes in plant-based nutrition and lifestyle medicine.Interestingly, Dr. McMacken wasn’t always all that intrigued by nutrition. Not surprisingly, her medical school experience was woefully lacking in this regard. But after eight years of medical practice, she was becoming progressively distressed by her obesity clinic patients’ general inability to get — and stay — healthy.Determined to find better, more sustainable solutions for her patients led to a search engine result for “lifestyle change” that prompted Michelle to attend the American College of Lifestyle Medicine Conference— a game-changing experience that enlightened her to a holistic, disease preventive perspective on patient care that ultimately reinvigorated and forever altered her medical practice.Beyond her one on one work with patients, many of which are underprivileged, what is uniquely inspiring about Dr. McMacken is her grant-funded commitment to study evidence-based nutritional protocols and apply the practical knowledge to faculty, colleagues & resident doctors. In other words, she is devoted to educating not only her patients about healthy nutrition, but her fellow medical professionals as well — filling the much needed gap in our current system of medical education.This is an enlightening and highly informative conversation that explores:I sincerely hope you enjoy our discussion.What is preventing you from a more holistic approach to long-term wellness? I’d love to hear about your personal challenges in the comments section below.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

July 22, 2015

“What gets me through the dark days is knowing that I can make a difference in someone else’s life if I apply myself.”Luke TyburskiAussie born, UK-dwelling adventure athlete Luke Tyburski isn’t superman. He’s not famous nor is he a world champion. And he’s the first to say he’s just not that talented. In most ways Luke is a normal bloke. An everyman who decided to face his debilitating battle with clinical depression through the lens of adventure and ultra-endurance sports.Soccer obsessed as a young boy, from the get go Luke realized he lacked the God-given athletic gifts enjoyed by his teammates. Nonetheless, perseverance prevailed and Luke achieved his life-long dream of traveling the world as a professional footballer.Unfortunately, that career was cut short by significant, chronic & persistent injuries. What followed was an unexpected yet quite severe bout with acute, clinical depression — a back hole of desperation that often left him bedridden and teetering on hopelessness.To escape this prison, Luke dug deep. Through sheer force of will matched with equal parts faith, he compelled his mutinying body, mind and spirit to simply get up, get outside and begin exploring again — one step at a time.Having never ran more than 10 kilometers at any one time, and with only six months to prepare, in 2012 Luke conquered the infamous Marathon des Sables, a 250 kilometer, six stage self-sufficient running race across the treacherous and unrelenting sand dunes of the Moroccan Sahara.Since then he has competed in a variety of adventure races, including the Mt. Everest Ultra Marathon. His first ever triathlon? The double ironman distance Double Brutal Extreme Triathlon.My kind of guy.Currently, Luke’s sights are set on achieving the truly extraordinary — a self-styled 12-day, 2000 kilometer adventure he calls The Ultimate Triathlon that kicks off in Morocco with a swim across the Straight of Gibraltar before cycling and running the coastline all the way to Monaco.It’s easy to admire the feats of the truly touched. It’s inspirational. But I cherish sharing stories like Luke’s because they are aspirational. And because relatable, everyman guys like Luke demonstrate that big dreams are possible and accessible for all.This is a conversation that explores:An adventurous life is a worth leading. Luke’s life is well worth the examination. I sincerely hope you enjoy our discussion.How can you invite more adventure into your life?

398,David Carter,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/david-carter-300-pound-vegan/,"Episode 160
July 19, 2015

“I can honestly say that being vegan is not only the most efficient way to be full-body strong, it’s also the most humane; everyone wins.”David CarterIt’s one thing to thrive on a plant-based diet as a skinny endurance athlete. But what about sports that place a premium on size, speed, agility, power, quickness and just plain brute force?Is it possible to compete at the highest level of the NFL not as a punt returner, not as a quarterback or even a running back, but as a defensive lineman – a position where only the absolute biggest, baddest, strongest and fastest survive?Meet David Carter — aka The 300 Pound Vegan.Introduced to the game at age 5, David began his football career playing Pop Warner. He made waves at Fontana’s Kaiser High School in Southern California and went on to become a star player at UCLA. In 2011, he was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the 6th round and has since been a bit of a journeyman defensive linebacker, playing for the Dallas Cowboys, the Oakland Raiders and most recently the Jacksonville Jaguars.Like most athletes, David grew up eating tons of meat, fully adhering to the conventional mythology that in order to become muscle you must consume muscle – the more the better.But as his career matured, David became plagued by a variety of persistent, chronic injuries including arthritis, tendonitis, nerve damage and chronic muscle fatigue. Not surprising given the nature of his job, but nonetheless devastating — ailments he simply could not overcome that left him sidelined despite the best sports medicine and rehabilitative resources of the NFL at his disposal.David soon realized that in order to continue playing, something had to change. He began researching the cause of his conditions, as well as alternative remedies to resolve them at the source. Heavily influenced by a series of documentaries that included Forks Over Knives and the holistic lifestyle habits practiced by his wife Paige, David arrived at a rather counter-intuitive conclusion for an athlete whose professional career relies entirely upon physical prowess and sheer brute force:all the nutrition he had been relying on to maximize his size and strength was actually killing him.Therefore, in February 2014, David made a rather radical and quite controversial decision: he adopted a 100% plant-based diet.Criticism came swift from all sides. Trainers, coaches, friends and fellow players all chimed the familiar refrain: it’s impossible to maintain your weight and strength without meat!But David has remained steadfast and confident in his decision.Why? Because a battery of unexpected positive results came and came quickly. Eating entirely plant-based, David experienced more energy. His recovery time was profoundly accelerated. His stamina went through the roof. To the great surprise of his coaches, trainers and teammates, every single one of those nagging, persistent injuries mysteriously corrected themselves and ultimately vanished altogether. All his numbers in the weight room actually went up – this is a guy who can bench 470 and squat 660. Amazingly, he found himself quicker, more agile and responsive than ever. And perhaps most important to David, no living thing had to die in order for him to thrive.Through football and his off the field advocacy for healthier lifestyles, animal rights and the planet, David is now devoted to a cause greater than his on field performance — being an example of positive change in the world.There is quite a bit of feverish intrigue and anticipation about this episode. I’m happy to report this conversation does not disappoint. It’s a special exchange with an exceptional human being that explores:I sincerely hope you enjoy our discussion & look forward to your thoughts in the comments section below.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“If you teach kids about nature they learn to nurture. And when children learn to nurture we as a society collectively embrace our better nature.”Stephen RitzInsurgent educator Stephen Ritz is truly one of the most inspiring game changers I have ever met. A South Bronx elementary school teacher and administrator, he has faced and overcome tremendous bureaucratic, political, and socio-economic odds to catapult generations of young, underprivileged at-risk students to unimaginable academic success and upwardly mobile employment — all while simultaneously reclaiming and rebuilding the Bronx from the inside out.The modality leveraged to serve this end? Food. Specifically, growing food.The personification of triple bottom line values and a staunch advocate of project-based, experiential learning, it all began when Stephen accidentally began growing plants in his classroom. The unexpected result was a level of student engagement even this maverick educator could not have predicted. So what began by fluke soon became Stephen’s passion. It wasn’t long before his Bronx classroom featured the first indoor edible wall in the entire New York City Department of Education — a wall that routinely generates enough produce to feed healthy meals to 450 students while also training the youngest nationally certified workforce in America.Stephen’s classroom farm would soon expand, both in the classroom and out, spreading across a community in desperate need for healthy food options. Under his spirited leadership and the tireless efforts of his student and community growers, vacant lots and rooftops across the Bronx — fairly characterized as an urban food desert — have been literally transformed, now boasting bountiful gardens that have produced more than 30,000 pounds of vegetables. Food that feeds his students and the greater borough at large.In the Bronx public school system, student attendance and graduation rates are historically abysmal. But Stephen’s passion and engagement with his students resulted in attendance skyrocketing from a mere 40 percent to 93 percent daily. Not to mention it helped create 2,200 youth jobs. And now he is committed to building the first ever independently financed National Health, Wellness and Biodiversity Center in a 100+ year old reclaimed Bronx public school library.The staggering success of Stephen’s non-traditional teaching methods have captured the world’s attention. His work has been featured in Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, ABC, CNN, NBC, NPR and beyond. Accolades include being one of three Americans named a 2015 Top Ten Finalist for the prestigious Global Teacher Prize— teaching’s Nobel Prize. He received the United States EPA Award for transforming mindsets and landscapes in New York City. And in 2014 he and his 4th and 5th grade students were invited to, and fêted by, none other than the White House.After viewing Stephen’s super inspiring TEDxManhattan Talk, ranked in the Top 25 Food / Education TED Talks of all time, I knew I had to have him on the show.Stephen followed this up with another stunning TEDx Talk:And if that’s not enough, this beautiful Upworthy short on Stephen and his work is sure to bring a tear to your eye:Stephen Ritz is the teacher you wish you had. The teacher every kid deserves. A true paradigm breaker, he sets the pace for future generations of teachers to come. Today we sit down to talk about:Prepare yourself, because this guy’s got enough energy to power a city. I guess that’s why they call him the Green Bronx Machine.It’s my honor and privilege to bring Stephen’s story to you today. If you are moved as I am, and it feels right to you, I implore you to consider donating to his most worthy cause.

“The coolest part about food is that it’s something that you get to eat. We get to eat color for a living. We get to eat color to bring us life. And so these things have all of these colors bring us life—and they have life—and that’s why raw food to me is so symbolic on a different level.”Kristina Carrillo-BucaramFor most of her young adult life, Kristina Carrillo-Bucaram was in and out of hospitals. Constantly sick, hyperglycemic, low on energy and losing hope that she could ever feel normal.Little did Kristina know that a chance encounter with a strange man at the grocery store would soon change everything, radically and permanently altering the trajectory of her life.This week I am delighted to sit down with the effervescent and passionate Fully Raw Kristina — as she is now popularly known on the internet – to hear all about how a raw vegan diet not only healed her body, but gave her life purpose.Boasting over 600,000 subscribers, many of you may know Kristina from her wildly popular YouTube Channel. For most, this would be an all consuming full time gig. But making videos is subservient to Kristina’s first passion, which is running Rawfully Organic – the food cooperative she founded in 2007 at age 20. What began in her living room is now the largest raw organic produce co-op in the United States, providing affordable, healthy raw produce to over 6000 members across the Houston area weekly.Although I would not label myself as fully raw, it’s fair to say that I eat tremendous amounts of raw plant foods every day and can personally attest to the importance of prioritizing a large variety of fresh raw produce on your plate at every meal.Nonetheless, I can hear you muttering under your breath: eating fully raw sounds so extreme! Is it possible to be healthy, vibrant and happy on raw plant foods alone? Won’t I suffer nutrition deficiencies? To quell these questions, Kristina visited 2-time RRP alumnus Garth Davis, M.D. for a checkup. Here’s how it went down:Forefront in today’s conversation is of course diet and nutrition.

“The reality is: if you’re not aligned in yourself, you’re not able to help. You’re really not in a place of being able to really be of service and that’s the beauty of going through a dark night or being pummeled a bit by life’s wonderful tumble-dry cycle.”Julie PiattTime to step it up.I am excited to announce that today marks my commitment to henceforth deliver two episodes of the RPP per week. Each week, from today forward I will post the show every Sunday night (as usual) plus every Wednesday night (late night Pacific Standard Time). Like today, sometimes it will be a Q&A episode; other times it will be the typical one-on-one guest format. Perhaps some of them will be topic-specific mini-sodes. Time will tell.To kick off this new and exciting growth phase, Julie and I are back with another installment of Ask Me Anything — a twist on my typical format where we answer questions submitted by you, the listener. I absolutely love this format, primarily because it connects me more deeply and authentically with the global community of people who enjoy the show. Because community is truly what it’s all about.It’s been an exciting time for us. In the last few months we launched The Plantpower Way and have been on the road spreading the word. Recently returned from an incredibly fruitful trip to New York City, Julie and I share a little behind the scenes and catch up on where things are headed with the podcast and our commitment to wellness advocacy.Then the conversation turns to listener submitted inquiries. A conversation that explores:The show concludes with I’m Here Now, written and performed by Julie (aka SriMati), accompanied by our sons Tyler & Trapper Piatt.Thank you everyone who submitted the 100’s of questions we reviewed. If we didn’t get to yours (obviously chances are we didn’t), don’t be shy & keep them coming. Until we settle on a web-based means of collecting and organizing listener submitted inquiries (if you have ideas on the best way to do this I’m all ears), please send your questions to info@richroll.com and we’ll do our best to answer!I sincerely hope you enjoy our discussion & look forward to your thoughts in the comments section below.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

404,Tucker Max,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/tucker-max/,"Episode 154
June 28, 2015

“All life really boils down to, for humans, are the relationships with the people you love and the things you do that matter to other people.”Tucker MaxThis week I’m going out on a limb.When the opportunity arose to sit down with Tucker Max, I admit to a little discomfort and trepidation. On the one, hand, I was genuinely honored he was interested in doing the show. On the other hand, I wasn’t convinced he was the right fit for what I do.To be sure, Tucker Max is a high performing super-achiever. He is incredibly bright. He is insanely accomplished. And he has millions of fans the world over. Nominated to TIME magazine’s “100 Most Influential List” of 2009, Tucker’s first book I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell* was a #1 New York Times Bestseller, spent 5 years on the list and ultimately sold over 2 million copies. He followed it up with two more books, both of which were also New York Times Bestsellers. Perhaps most impressive? Tucker is one of only three writers — along with Malcolm Gladwell and Michael Lewis — to ever have three books on the New York Times Non-Fiction Bestseller List at the same time.Tucker Max is a publishing juggernaut. Irrespective of whatever opinion you may hold about the content of those books, you cannot deny that is a towering achievement.However, it’s these very books, the fratire genre he singlehandedly birthed, and Tucker’s very public persona as America’s foremost bro — well known for his healthy ego, brash opinions and candid chronicling of his outlandish partying exploits – that gave me considered pause.Do I really want to talk to a guy who wrote a book called Assholes Finish First?* It’s just not my scene. It’s not what I’m about. I don’t support those ideas. I’m not interested in that guy. It’s not me. But what is interesting, and why I ultimately decided to go forward with this interview, is that’s not Tucker either. At least not any more.The Tucker Max of today is not the same hard drinking, hard partying, womanizing Tucker Max that made him famous and rich.In the wake of his staggering success, Tucker woke up to realize that all the material benefits he worked so hard to attain just weren’t quite all they were cracked up to be. None of it made him happy.So what then? Ego must submit to introspection. Entering a period of honest self-reflection, Tucker took inventory of his life. He underwent psychological analysis. He asked himself the hard questions. What is truly important?In a word, Tucker Max grew up.Emerging from that former guy far more self-actualized, Tucker is telling a new story. Retired from fratire writing and the partying lifestyle, Tucker is now happily married (yes, monogamous) with Bishop, his newborn son. Today he is an angel investor and start up entrepreneur with a successful and exciting new venture designed to democratize publishing called Book In A Box. He co-founded and co-hosts The Mating Grounds, a popular podcast designed to help men have successful relationships with women. And September marks the release of his new book Mate*, focused on helping men find Miss Right not by being assholes, but by becoming the best version of themselves.Trust me, the irony of this arc is hardly lost on Tucker.Here’s the deal. If this podcast is about anything, it’s about transformation. Getting honest with yourself and owning your truth. It’s about evolving. Overcoming negative habits. Letting go of things that no longer serve you.It’s about growth. I was keen to explore these themes with Tucker. I really wanted to know why he decided to change. What prompted it and how he did it. I wanted to know how he currently perceives his past; and what he’s interested in now. Most all, I wanted to know what can be mined from his experience that can be of benefit for all of us.Don’t get me wrong. Tucker is still Tucker. Dynamic, charismatic, razor sharp, opinionated, unapologetic and at times characteristically ribald. But I also found him to be highly engaging; poised and pleasantly introspective.This is a conversation that explores:Quick note: there are a few instances of explicit language and a couple off color stories. But hey, its Tucker Max. It goes with the territory. So maybe pop in the earbuds if you’re at work or driving around with the kiddos.In all honesty, I really enjoyed this conversation. We had a great time.

June 21, 2015

“What am I supposed to eat? How can it be that every beast, every fish, every insect—every other critter on the face of the planet—can figure this out so easily, and yet here we are, still wondering?”Darin OlienWhat’s it like to traipse the far outreaches of the globe in search of the the world’s greatest edible food sources for optimal health?Meet the Indiana Jones of Superfoods.This week my friend Darin Olien joins me to share insights and wisdom from his extraordinary adventure-based experiences as a widely recognized exotic superfoods hunter, wellness advocate & environmental activist.Darin’s passion was seeded early. Attending his father’s lectures on agricultural business at the University of Minnesota birthed an early appreciation of whole food nutrition. But it wasn’t until a football injury sidelined a frustrated young Darin that his curiosity in the relationship between food and health begin to truly take root. A curiosity that began with a simple question:There must be a better way to heal myself.The intrigue that evolved from that initial query has been an ongoing, twenty-year plus quest for better, more natural pathways to ultimate wellness. A journey that led Darin to study exotic, indigenous herbs and superfoods from every imaginable port of call across the developing world. Communing with thousands of rural farmers, growers and manufacturers in remote communities across Peru, Bhutan, the Amazon, the Himalayas, the South Pacific, Latin America and Asia, Darin now shepherds high-quality, fair-trade superfoods and herbal commodities to market through his company, Darin’s Naturals.Perhaps best known for his work with fitness company Beachbody, Darin was instrumental in the development and ongoing formulation of the wildly successful whole-food supplement, Shakeology. He chronicles his experience in his new book Superlife: The 5 Forces That Will Make You healthy, Fit & Eternally Awesome – as well as on his website Superlife.com – where he demystifies health, fitness, nutrition, and longevity into simple daily actions designed to promote life-long wellness.What is most intriguing to me isn’t just that Darin is a respected authority on the healing potential of food. And it isn’t just that he has been instrumental in introducing these so called superfoods to western consumers. What is most interesting is his commitment to do it right. A deep rooted responsibility to fairly, sustainably and transparently support the grower communities and their long-term interests.Ripped and Malibu sun kissed, Darin more than resembles a plant-based version of his friend and workout buddy Laird Hamilton. So it would be natural to presume he has always been a model of health and fitness. But that presumption would be misplaced. Because for Darin it wasn’t always this way. Like all of us, Darin has faced many challenging and relatable life obstacles on his path to living what I think is fair to characterize as his best, most authentic superlife.At the same time, the term superfoods is prone to cavalier overuse. Are these foods truly “super” or is it all just exaggerated marketing hype?This is a conversation that explores that issue and so much more.I sincerely hope you enjoy this exchange with a man who exudes positive energy, passion and enthusiasm for health.

June 14, 2015

“Fixing the way I thought about myself and what is possible changed my life—more than plants, more than running, more than any of these things—it’s what went on inside my mind.”Josh LaJaunieJosh LaJaunie is perhaps the most inspirational everyman example of healthy, transformative living I have ever met.After 151 episodes of the podcast, our first initial conversation back in December of 2013 (RRP 63) is to this day one of the most popular, most downloaded episodes in the history of the show. If you missed it, please make a point of listening to this amazing exchange here.That conversation transpired on Skype. We had never actually met. Now we have. At Healthfest in Marshall, TX a few months back I had the opportunity to spend an entire weekend with Josh. It was a memorable experience that left me more impressed than ever with this fine young man. Not just because he has overcome tremendous obstacles to restore and maintain his health. Not just because he continues to impressively evolve as an athlete and runner. But because of the exemplary human being he has become. A big spirit who continues to grow. A giant heart and shining example of service — constantly educating and inspiring his loved ones and community at large.The story — as laid out in his self-penned manifesto “Free Josh LaJaunie”— goes like this:In November of 2013, this guy I had never heard of called Josh LaJaunie tweeted me his before and after pictures. The change was so astonishing, my first thought was, can this be real? The 400+ pound guy on the left bore almost no resemblance to the guy on the right, a super fit, handsome young man running with a big smile on his face.Chris Farley had morphed into Bradley Cooper. But how?On a lark, I invited him on the podcast. I had no idea his story — more importantly his ability to own and tell his story — would be so extraordinary. The experience left me and everyone who tuned in indelibly changed. Ever since, I have felt inexplicably bonded to a guy I never actually met.In short, Josh accomplished what some would deem impossible, dropping over 200 pounds and a life-long addiction to unhealthy foods & lifestyle habits to discover a passion for running. A journey that led him to completing multiple marathons and more recently his first ultramarathon. He didn’t just lose weight. And he didn’t just keep the weight off. He became an athlete.A real athlete.Most impressive is how he faced, battled and overcame astounding, impossibly entrenched cultural obstacles to change everything about how he lives his life. A gift he now freely and quite joyously shares, permanently transforming the lives of everyone who crosses his path.Is this really the same guy? Yes.Born & bred in southern Louisiana, Josh is a 100% genuine, authentic, self-avowed “swamp dweller” from Bayou Lafourche. A big kid with an even bigger heart surrounded by a loving nuclear and extended family united by their shared adoration of food. Josh was a standout high school football player, recruited to play college ball. But disillusioned by college life in Arkansas, he dropped out of school, only to return home, aimless and unmoored. He found work in the family construction business, but lived for the weekend – time spent hunting, fishing, cheering for his beloved New Orleans Saints, feasting on his favorite local delicacies — po boys, jambalaya & barbeque. And partying. Lots of partying. It’s just what you do down in Bayou Lafourche.The weight escalated.  As did the despair.  His embarrassment and shame escalating in equal measure to his declining self-esteem and overall well being.Then something happened.  In 2010, Josh’s beloved Saints achieved the impossible, winning the Super Bowl. It seems a small thing. But to Josh it was everything. Forever altering his perception of what is possible, he began to question the limits he imposed upon himself. Empowered, he began to “let go of his normal” and dismiss the embedded “that’s just the way it is down here” mentality he was starting to understand often taints the logic of his region.A chain reaction of events ensued that set Josh on a new trajectory. A path that involved a return to fitness and the adoption of a 100% plant-based diet. A path that changed everything about his life in impossibly unpredictable ways.A life transformed.It’s one thing to “go vegan” in Santa Monica, California. But it’s another thing entirely in Thibodaux, Louisiana. No plant-friendly restaurants. No Whole Foods Market. Essentially zero community support. An environment where unhealthy food isn’t just a choice, but a celebrated cultural imperative. Some might even say a religion.That Josh cut against the grain is an understatement. To embrace the plant-based lifestyle didn’t just mean an open invitation to ridicule. It meant risking complete social ostracization.I am proud to once again give Josh a well-deserved microphone to share his powerful, continually evolving story. But I am more proud to call him a friend.brother from another motherI sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation, which picks up where we last left off. A conversation certain to erase whatever obstacles and excuses you rely on that perpetuate bad habits, keep you stuck, and reinforce denial. A conversation that explores:By listening, my hope is that you will realize that no matter what your circumstances or environment, we all have the power to implement profound personal change beyond our collective imagination in miraculous and fantastic ways.You’re a good man Josh LaJaunie.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“If you don’t have the ability to celebrate what you have now, nothing you get—and I mean nothing; nothing material, nothing experiential, no amount information, no amount of experience, no amount of material possessions—is going to teach you how to celebrate.”WuDeToday my friend WuDe returns to the show to drop some mad Zen Buddhist wisdom.In case you missed it, I strongly encourage you to dial up our first conversation. RRP #87: Art & The Importance of Living Tea is a fascinating deep dive into the world, history, and ancient teachings of tea as a means to glean broader truths about health, healing, community, the environment, and oneness – the universal interconnectedness of everything.During that initial conversation, we barely scratched the surface with respect to the extensive knowledge and wisdom brimming from WuDe’s soul. So when he returned for recent visit to Los Angeles, I jumped on the chance to have him back on the show. A rare opportunity to more fully mine the philosophy and the traditions of Zen Buddhism to help us better navigate our modern lives.Born in the United States as Aaron Daniel Fisher, Wude was drawn to the East from a very early age. After studying philosophy in college, he traveled the world and ultimately settled in Taiwan, where he has since become a Buddhist monk. A tea master. And the founder of Global Tea Hut— a school and center that harvests tea, educates all comers on the traditions surrounding tea, and welcomes people from all over the world to study the Dao of Tea as a method of spiritual cultivation.I said it in reference to our first conversation. I’ll say it again.This just might be the most fascinating and soul expanding conversation you will hear all week.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“…that’s what medical school does – it teaches you to treat symptoms; it doesn’t teach you to treat a larger cause; it doesn’t teach food as medicine.”Garth Davis, MDThis week marks the return of Garth Davis, MD — a veteran weight loss surgeon who took it upon himself to determine exactly why so many people are plagued by obesity. A quest that led him down a deep research hole to identify the ultimate human diet to maximize and maintain weight loss; optimize human health; and prevent (and even reverse) lifestyle disease — both for himself and his patients (tune in to RRP 50 for our first conversation).About 7 years ago, the good doctor became his own patient. At the time, he was suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure and a fatty liver. In other words, he was downright sick; headed towards a future plagued by obesity and chronic illness. Ironic, yes. But not surprising given the demanding hours of the surgeon lifestyle, lack of exercise, a preference for salty, fatty foods, and the convenience of fast food options in the hospital cafeteria. In fact, there was a Wendy’s in the University of Michigan hospital where Garth did his internship and residency, resulting in a daily dose of  double cheeseburgers — a habit he maintained for years.Let’s just say I can relate.Current conventional wisdom in his field is that overweight patients should adopt a very low carb, low to no fruit, high protein diet — hop on board the ketosis bandwagon. Like many, and without inquiring further, Garth simply bought into this idea as truth. He even wrote a book in 2007 advocating this approach to food, called The Experts Guide To Weight Loss Surgery*.The only problem? This approach to diet failed him and many other friends, colleagues and patients. He knew there had to be a better solution. And his patients needed help beyond knee-jerk surgery. Finally ready for a personal change, he took it upon himself to research — truly research — nutrition for the first time.His study became an obsession. The more he delved into the peer reviewed work, the more convinced he became that there is absolutely no legitimate science to back the long-term health claims surrounding the strongly held belief that if we want to be thin and healthy we should eat a high protein low carbohydrate diet.What did he find? If we want to prevent obesity and disease; attain and maintain ideal weight management; and achieve true optimal health and long-term wellness, we need to embrace our inner herbivore.Sound far-fetched? Before you balk, understand that (much like me) adopting a plant-based lifestyle absolutely revolutionized Garth’s health beyond what he could have imagined. Not only did he drop the weight that plagued him for years, all of his blood markers suddenly and quite magically normalized. His allergies vanished. His sleep improved, his energy levels skyrocketed and he got off his statin medications. In short, he finally began to walk his talk. As his life began to turn around, he wanted to be an example to his patients. For the first time in his life, he began exercising.Then he did the extraordinary. Despite never having been an athlete, in 2011 he completed Ironman Texas in 12 hours and 6 minutes.His personal results nothing short of extraordinary, Garth has become a crusader intent on teaching people real nutrition. I encourage you to peruse his Facebook page for a litany of highly entertaining and informative rants on how the internet pseudo-experts are manipulating the science to push high protein diet and how to parse fact from fiction in the scientific literature. Come October, you can get the full unabridged Garth in his new book, Proteinaholic: How Our Obsession With Meat Is Killing Us and What We Can Do About It*.Let’s face it. Most doctors are kind of boring. What really distinguishes Garth from the fray is his acute talent for effectively communicating his knowledge with passion and charisma in a way that catalyzes positive long lasting change — and that my friends is rare.This is an in depth exploration of all the questions that profoundly confuse the mainstream. Subjects I get asked about everyday, such as:Dr. Davis is nothing if not outspoken. His position is unequivocal.Bottom line? I wanted this show to be the one podcast that would cut through the morass of confusion and hype surrounding popular diet trends and set the record (and my perspective) straight. Let’s just say Dr. Garth delivers, and then some.This is one for the ages.

“You can set as many goals as you want. But without belief and conviction, it won’t happen.”James “Iron Cowboy” LawrenceUPDATE: July 26, 2015. He did it. Yesterday I had the great honor and privilege of running the final marathon with James, and watching him cross the finish line on his 50th ironman in 50 states in 50 days to the deafening cheers of over 1,000 fans in attendance. What James has accomplished isn’t just stunning — it’s truly one of the greatest achievements in the history of (voluntary) human endurance. We made plans to do a follow up podcast today, but alas he lost his voice taking the time to talk to all his fans late into the evening last night. However, I promise we will reconvene very soon so I can bring you the full story, pillar to post. Until then, please enjoy this prefatory conversation.People roll their eyes in incredulity when I tell them about my experience completing 5 ironman-distance triathlons on five Hawaiian Islands in under a week. If you are one of those people, brace yourself. This week’s guest will blow the lid off everything you thought you knew about human potential. The capacity to suffer. And the will to endure.James Lawrence — aka the Iron Cowboy — is a husband. A proud father of five kids. And an athlete with two Guinness World Records in triathlon: most 70.3 races in a calendar year (22 in 30 weeks) and most Ironman triathlons in a calendar year (30).Nonetheless, James is restless. He knows he is capable of so much more.So just two weeks from today, on June 6, 2015 the Iron Cowboy will strive for the seemingly impossible when he attempts a challenge so mind numbing I get delirious just thinking about it:50 Ironman courses, 50 consecutive days, through all 50 States.You read it correctly. James’ impending adventure is literally 10x the magnitude and degree of difficulty of anything I have personally experienced — a challenge that will test James’ mind, body and soul beyond anything I can personally fathom.The best part? He is inviting everyone to join with him. This week I sit down with James to sort it all out:I found James to be surprisingly grounded; extremely gracious; and quite large at heart. But if I am being completely honest, I have serious doubts about the plausibility of him succeeding in his 50/50/50 quest. I have no doubt James can do 50 Ironman-distance triathlons in 50 states.  It’s the 50 days part that gets me. Because it leaves absolutely zero room for error. None. And if there is one thing I know about adventures of this ilk, error is an indispensable part if the equation. It’s not if something will go wrong. The question is when.Please don’t misunderstand. I’m a fan. James is one of the good guys. Someone easy to pull for. I want to see him succeed and you will too. So let’s get behind James and his extraordinary goal. Check out his website. Consider throwing him a donation on Indiegogo. Toss some love his way on Twitter and Instagram. Peruse his schedule and if/when he passes through your locale this summer, make a point to go out and log a few miles with him.Together we can put some much needed wind in his sails. And more often than not it’s that little extra boost that marks the difference between achieving the impossible and giving up altogether.I appreciate James sharing his story with me. I look forward to cheering him on as this adventure unfolds and I sincerely hope you do too.

May 21, 2015

“Electronic culture created soulless replacements for connective rituals — television supplanted tribal legends told by the fire; ‘fast food’ consumed in distraction took the place of a shared meal. We substituted matter for Mater (feminine principle), money for mother’s milk, objects for emotional bonds.”Daniel PinchbeckPhilosopher. Author. Futurist. Counter culture provocateur.Described as a mashup of James Merrill, H. P. Lovecraft, and Carlos Castaneda, I was first introduced to Daniel Pinchbeck through his rather fascinating metaphysical study of prophesy in 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl*— a book that explored humanity’s precarious balance between greater self-potential and environmental disaster.Raised by Beat generation parents — his mother dated Jack Kerouac around the time On The Road exploded on the scene — Daniel’s roots in the New York counterculture movement run deep. Throughout the 1990s, Pinchbeck matured into a member of New York’s literary select. He wrote for publications such as The New York Times Magazine, Esquire, Rolling Stone and Harper’s Bazaar.But slowly something happened. As he approached his late twenties, he describes falling into a deep spiritual crisis fueled by a frustration with the inherent shortcomings of mainstream media and a friend’s sudden passing due to a heroin overdose. Despair ultimately led him to an investigation of shamanism. Embracing metaphysical belief systems, his psyche and body began to open to the mystical. His first book, Breaking Open the Head*, chronicled these experiences and observations from a first hand perspective and was heralded as the most significant on psychedelic experimentation since the work of Terence McKenna.Today, everything Mayan, shamanistic and post-modern psychedelia seems to always point to this uniquely perspicacious, probing mind. And I think it’s fair to say that Daniel is considered a leading pioneer of the post-modern psychedelic movement, advocating a measured, responsible exploration of shamanistic cultural rites and the substances they employ to expand consciousness.If Daniel is anything, he is a maverick, persistently challenging social, political, economic and cultural paradigms. A man searching for answers both personal and global, his insights are both provocative and fascinating, and more often than not imbued with hope for a better (if not idealized) future world.A confession: Daniel has a prodigious intellect. I admit to being a bit intimidated. Moreover, I have no experience with psychedelics, and as a sober person in recovery it is unlikely I ever will. So I was unsure as to whether interviewing him would be a good idea or even appropriate for this show. But the opportunity arose and I couldn’t imagine passing it up.I’m glad I didn’t. Much like my recent conversation with Tom Hardin, this episode marks a departure into new terrain for me. On a personal level, I found Daniel to be engaging, introspective and not surprisingly possessed with the rare ability to muse on a vastly diverse array of challenging themes.This is a fascinating — albeit at times challenging — mind-bender deep dive into Daniel’s paradigm breaking vision that explores:So let’s take a trip down the rabbit hole through the looking glass that is the consciousness of Daniel Pinchbeck.I genuinely hope you enjoy this conversation and look forward to your thoughts in the comments section below.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“If you want to put yourself on the edge as an athlete, like I do in a race car or in training for a triathlon, you have to be treating the food that’s going in your body like rocket fuel. You can’t be putting garbage in your body and expecting rocket results.”Landon CassillIt’s time to explore what it takes to be competitive in one of the most popular professional sports in the United States — NASCAR.Meet Landon Cassill.Driver. Triathlete. Husband. Plant-based.Racing as far back as he can remember, at just 19 years of age Landon burst onto the national scene as the 2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series Rookie of the Year. In 2013, he broke the track record at the famous Gresham Motorsports Park track. Now 25, Landon pilots the #40 Chevrolet SS for the Hillman-Circle Sport LLC team and the #01 Flex Seal Chevrolet for JDMotorsports in the NASCAR Nationwide Series.Beyond Will Ferrell’s turn in Talledega Nights, NASCAR (make that auto racing in general) is a world I know close to nothing about. So it was really fun to sit down with Charlotte-based Landon to explore his personal story; the very specific and peculiar culture of NASCAR; what it really takes to professionally toe the line at prestigious races like the Daytona 500; and how diet and triathlon have come to play a crucial role in Landon’s daily success equation.Extremely likable and humble beyond expectation, I think it’s fair to say this Iowa-bred young man is a fine living example of solid midwestern values and what can transpire when lifelong passion meets true drive, keen focus and a Malcolm Gladwell-esque 10,000+ hours of very hard work, sweat and determination.This is a great conversation that explores:On May 24, Landon will be racing the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. After competing in NASCAR’s longest and most challenging test of man and machine, Landon will pioneer an entirely new form of endurance multi-sport when he jumps out of his car post-race, laces up his running shoes and tacks on an additional 14 miles for the day with a run from Charlotte Motor Speedway to the NASCAR Hall of Fame. The Cassil 614 will kick off Snap Fitness’s “Snap Serves” summer campaign, which honors those who have served in the military and encourages people around the country to start their fitness journey.“I’m honored to have the opportunity to combine my passion for running with encouraging others to embrace a healthy lifestyle while recognizing those who have dedicated their lives to protecting our country. My goal with this post-race run is to motivate the sport’s fan base to get up and make fitness a priority this summer.” – Landon CassillBetween now and Landon’s big day, do me a solid and let’s pump him up for this challenge by giving him a supportive shout out on Twitter at @landoncassill.I genuinely hope you enjoy this glimpse into the passionate life of Landon Cassill — my version of Talledega Nights.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

May 10, 2015

“I am my own undoing. But there have been many positives to come out of it.”Tom HardinThis week we explore some very new terrain.Let’s kick it off with the Greek myth of Icarus.As the story goes, Daedalus — a master craftsman best known for building King Minos’ labyrinth to trap the Minotaur — plied his talent to construct a pair of wax and feather wings to help him and his son Icarus escape from Minos’ vendetta (it’s a long story) and Crete altogether.Being the good father he was, Daedalus pled with his son not to fly too close to the sun for fear that the heat would melt the wings. But as sons are wont to do, Icarus ignored his father’s advice.The rest is history. The heat indeed melted Icarus’ wings, sending him into a deathly free fall collision with the sea which today bears his name, the Ikarian Sea near Ikaria — ironically one of the Blue Zones as described in my recent podcast conversation with Dan Buettner.As most know, this is an age-old remonstration about ambition. A tragic allegory about the perils of hubris, particularly when fueled by a sense of entitlement, and perhaps sprinkled with a light dusting of denial.These are all very human traits of course. And if today’s guest is anything, he is quite human indeed.Tom Hardin was a highly motivated young guy with a big bright future and Wall Street aspirations. After graduating from the prestigious Wharton School of Business, he was on track to achieve his dream when he landed in the fast paced hedge fund world and quickly rose through the ranks.But it wasn’t long before Tom felt he was falling behind – lacking that mysterious competitive ‘edge’ so many others seemed to freely enjoy (without repercussion) to their reward in untold millions.What was that edge? If you ask Tom, he will tell you the not so secret to success within the insular hedge fund world meant having a network of inside sources willing to share reliable confidential information about companies they worked for or with.Everybody’s doing it. Nobody’s getting caught. I’m falling behind.Then one day Tom got a call from an investor colleague named Roomy Khan – a woman with some pretty juicy insider tips.The timing was right. Tom was primed. And that fateful moment arose. That moment when you make a decision to take a very small step over a very important line. A decision you simply cannot undo. Not now, not ever.For Tom, it started with taking a few small crumbs off the table. An imperceptible insider trade here, another one there. Until one day, the previously unthinkable became easy. Almost too easy.Capitalizing on a handful of secrets fed by Khan and others about companies like Google, 3Com and Hilton Hotels, Tom’s flight towards the sun escalated to the tune of $1.7 million in gains for his fund and $46K in personal profits.Then in July 2008, while dropping of his dry cleaning one morning, Tom felt a tap on the shoulder. A tap that would alter the trajectory of his life forever.Like a scene out of a movie, Tom turned to face two FBI agents boxing him in with with a Hobson’s choice – either get in the back of the black sedan for a trip downtown, or start providing actionable information on those higher up the food chain.Panicked and heart pounding, he immediately opted for the latter.Ultimately, Tom became one of the most prolific informants in securities fraud history. Soon infamous as the mysterious, unnamed Tipper X, Tom spent the next several years wiretapping and documenting the illegal misdeeds of friends and colleagues as an instrumental, key figure in what the FBI deemed “Operation Perfect Hedge” — a Wall Street house-cleaning campaign that matured into the biggest insider trading case of this generation.
When the dust settled, Tom’s cooperation led to over two dozen convictions, most notably the toppling of billionaire and Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam, who was accused of making $75 million personally and is now serving an 11-year prison term.Due to his extraordinary cooperation, Tom avoided jail time, but did not escape the scarlet 5-letter word: felon.Although his wife and family stood steadfast, Tom lost his job, his friends, his standing in the community, his dream, his sense of self and what his life was supposed to be. His relationship with sanity started to slip. With right and wrong confused, heavy bouts with depression ensued. His spirit sank in proportion to his expanding waistline.Today he finds himself unemployable. Racked by guilt. Afraid. And, it can be fairly said, quite alone.I am my own undoing.Our culture thrives on schadenfreude. But it’s easy to judge when we’re watching comfortably from the sidelines. Whether it’s a professional cyclist’s decision to dope or a trader’s choice to barter on insider information, we all think we would make a different decision. I know I do.But I also know that unless I have walked a mile in someone else’s shoes, it’s not my place to say with any degree of certainty what I would have done under similar circumstances.But that’s not really the question I am interested in. From my perspective, it’s far more interesting to explore:Tragedy can be recast as divine. Not just as an opportunity for a second chance, but as a true gift — a brief moment in which the door cracks open, the light shines in and the stars align to provide a rare opportunity to harness the painful past; learn something crucial about yourself; set a new trajectory; and ultimately transform everything about who you are to become an entirely different and better person altogether.I won’t say Tom is there yet. He remains unclear on where his life might lead. But his journey has begun — a soulful exploration and search for answers he is slowly beginning to discover through community service; a newly discovered love of ultrarunning; and his simple willingness to entrust me with his story.I am honored that Tom agreed to sit down with me in March (just weeks after his sentencing hearing) to share — for the very first time on record — the details behind the choices he has made, the wreckage it has caused and what he has learned about himself in the process.Snitch? Hero?Maybe both. Maybe neither. Maybe more complicated than that. Probably.Whatever your take, I applaud the courage it took to engage me in this conversation. Candor, vulnerability and raw honesty are hard to come by, and Tom demonstrates it today in spades. I’m proud to share this exchange and my hope is that you find something compelling about the human condition that will better inform your own path.I genuinely hope you enjoy the conversation and look forward to your thoughts in the comments section below.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Warriors stand up for the innocent. The real heroes are the ones that are out there defending the innocent, the voiceless…”Timothy ShieffWhen the question turns to living your truth, this first line from Timothy Shieff’s self-authored bio says it all:I’m a Human practicing Being.Widely considered one of the world’s best Freerunners (more commonly referred to as parkour), Timothy — aka Livewire — specializes in a death and gravity defying skill set that leaves mere mortals agape. Scaling buildings and leaping off rooftops with effortless grace, Tim is a perfect physical manifestation of focus, coordination, strength, agility and fearlessness.Indeed, this proper and polite young English lad can do things you can’t. And yet his expression is fueled not by competitive drive, but by something deeper. Tim’s particular brand of parkour is subversive. Reframing the inanimate building, rooftop, curb or railing, Tim inverts the human relationship between human and object. Truly a social and political performance artist, Tim leaves me inspired to live more harmoniously with our ever-changing environment.Despite captaining Team Europe to a world championship on American Ninja Warrior (and setting records along the way), Tim’s athleticism runs a distant second to his passion for advocacy. A powerful young voice in the vegan movement, Tim wakes up every morning enthusiastic to not only expand his own horizons, but inspire others to do the same.Tim jumping off my roof before we sat down for RRP #86. Unbelievable.But more than any of this, it’s Tim’s spirit that moves me, and why I’m so proud to introduce his return to the RRP. In case you missed it, be sure to check out my first conversation with Tim — RRP #86.Intelligent and articulate beyond his years, my hope is that this conversation leaves you with a new mindfulness and perspective on your path and priorities; pondering the impact of our consumer choices on the planet; and questioning culturally entrenched assumptions about the relationship between nutrition and extraordinary athletic performance.I genuinely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

Look back at your life whether you’re 13 years old or 80 years old and it’s always the hardest times that made you who you are.”Casey NeistatThis week marks the return of my friend Casey Neistat to the podcast.Where to even begin…As a filmmaker credentialed with co-creating an HBO series and laurels from prestigious outlets like Cannes, Sundance and the Independent Spirit Awards, one would expect an artist of his pedigree to be directing feature films, documentaries and television shows for mainstream media. And yet sometime around 2010, Casey opted for the road less travelled, putting the traditional filmmaker path in his rearview to blaze a different and quite surprising path more in alignment with his DIY sensibilities:YouTube.The great irony is that in embracing the most democratic of platforms as his primary artistic outlet, Casey has indeed become one of the most compelling and culturally relevant voices of his generation.From his sensational  “Make It Count”  (my fave) to his poignant  “What Would You Do with $25,000?”  to his gleeful  “Snowboard NYC”,  Casey has logged over 129 million YouTube views, compelling Wired Magazine to remark,  “Casey Neistat’s bite-size Internet movies have so much viral potential they make influenza jealous.”  Let’s not even get into his continent-sized following on Snapchat (check out his ancillary  Snap Stories YouTube Channel ), or the fact that he recently began posting a daily vlog so stellar, suddenly every other vlogger looks remedial. Putting out a volume of content that would rival a major network, Casey Neistat is truly a do-it-yourself triumph — famed and fêted for unceasingly documenting his life, globe-trotting adventures and myriad curiosities with boundless perspicacity and bootstrapping panache.So what is it exactly that makes Casey’s work so irresistible? Maybe it’s simply because he knows how to tell insanely great personal stories. Perhaps it’s his rapier-like knack for tapping the zeitgeist pulse. His fidelity to authenticity. Or his expertise when it comes to connecting emotionally with a signature style that always leaves you yearning for more.If you ask me what sets Casey apart, it’s something else entirely:an absolute disregard for failure.That, and a profound work ethic. He makes it look easy, but make no mistake: Casey Neistat works way harder than you do.No, you can’t have his life. But you can have your own. To echo Casey, if you are doing it like everyone else, you’re doing it wrong. So stop following the heard.Define your own path.It was a treat to once again drop in on his singular Lower Manhattan studio —  “one of the most compulsively organized, ridiculously customized, and mind-bogglingly gear-saturated spaces on Planet Awesome”  — and I am pumped to share this conversation with one of the most interesting, creative, prolific — and in my opinion important — visual artists working today.NOTE: this is a short one. Just as I was starting to hit my conversational stride, at 45 minutes in Casey had to pull the plug. As you will hear, it makes for a rather abrupt, albeit somewhat comedic end to the podcast. I’m back in NYC for 10 days in June, so I will do my best to pick things up where we left off. Nonetheless, plenty of gems to mine. And yes of course, he made a little Snapchat story about the whole affair:If you didn’t tune in for our first conversation, you really should — it’s great.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

April 23, 2015

“Transformation is not for the weak at heart. It is the warrior path.”Julie PiattI have some serious sustainability concerns about doing two podcasts a week. It’s just an absurd amount of work. But I’m keeping my promise. Plus, I’m having fun. So here we go with another round of Ask Me Anything — a twist on my typical long-form interview format where we speak to the issues you want addressed.This is my way of deepening my connection with the global community of people who enjoy the show. And community is the very thing that carries the potential energy to truly shift cultural paradigms across the globe, one listener at a time.Today marks one week until our new book  The Plantpower Way*  hits stores all across North America. It’s been quite a mind blowing journey to arrive at this quite privileged place, so Julie and I check in on where things currently stand in our Herculean attempt to launch a plant-based lifestyle primer into the mainstream.Long story short? Everything is going great. To be totally transparent, today we eclipsed 4,000 books pre-sold and over 1.5 million in social reach on our Thunderclap campaign. Unbelievable!This is because of you. The support you have given us is beyond what we could have ever imagined, so please know that our appreciation runs deep. Very deep.And yet much work remains to be done. If we want to hit the NY Times Bestseller List and catapult the book — and the plant-based movement — into the cultural zeitgeist, we need to sell at least 7,000 books before May 1.We simply cannot do this alone. So far the TODAY Show hasn’t called. We’re getting no love from Dr. Oz, Good Morning America, John Stewart or any other major national news outlet. So when I say we are relying on you — the community — to step up and help get the word out and make this happen, I f*$ing mean it.If you are a fan of the podcast and all the content I work tirelessly to provide free each week, this is your moment of reckoning. The fact that our amazing pre-order gift bundles expire on April 28 should be enough self-serving motivation to act. But if not, consider this: despite your assumed personal proclivity for all things wellness, right now millions of people across the world are sick; stuck in a downward spiral of negative eating and lifestyle habits that promote disease and are unnecessarily killing us. 70% of Americans are obese or overweight. 1 out of every 3 Americans will die of heart disease. By 2030, 50% of us will be diabetic or pre-diabetic. Meanwhile America is exporting this lifestyle overseas with reckless abandon. And yet 80-90% of chronic lifestyle illness is preventible or reversible via simple diet and lifestyle changes.The Plantpower Way is the solution to this insanity.This not hyperbole. If my story means anything, it’s that sustainable health and well being is accessible and available to us all, irrespective of age or circumstance. And I promise that this book will get you there — the most powerful, life altering gift you can give to yourself; to your loved ones; to your children; to our animal friends; and to the planet.We encourage all of you to support independent bookstores by ordering from your local retailer (and engage them to place extra orders for future customers), but for those moved by my call to action that demand instant gratification, these links will get you right where you want to be: Amazon*  |  Barnes & Noble  |  IndieBound  |  iTunes  |  Penguin *Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

April 19, 2015

“Most people assume that meditation is all about stopping thoughts, getting rid of emotions, somehow controlling the mind. But actually it’s … about stepping back, seeing the thought clearly, witnessing it coming and going.”Andy PuddicombeI was first introduced to meditation and mindfulness principles 17 years ago during my 100-day voluntary incarceration in what is more amiably referred to as rehab.Initially, I balked at the concept. How can stillness possibly improve my life?Intellectually, I attributed every decent personal achievement not to innate talent, let alone some intangible force of the Universe. Instead I credited my prodigious work ethic — a huge capacity to grind harder and longer than my peers. Get up early. Stay late. Put in the extra mile. Repeat. Never stop.Do more.At best, stillness meant stasis. Mostly I wrote it off as regressive — wasted time lost. The purview of flaky, new-age hippies who couldn’t begin to fathom my logic-based intellect, understand my terminally unique life problems, nor comprehend how I successfully navigated the world.Always good for a solid re-sizing, my rehab counselor — let’s call him Hugh because that’s his name — reminded me of one simple, powerful fact:My best thinking landed me in a mental institution.That blast of truth and humility fell on my head like a ton of bricks. In recovery, they call it self-will run riot. And that was me, in a nutshell — a desperate hope to die alcoholic. A broken young man who had squandered promise and destroyed his life, literally tightrope walking the divide that separates life and death.Hardly a vision for you, It was time to try something different.Surrender. At the time, I perceived this concept as synonymous with defeat. Anathema to my core idea of who I was. But Hugh was right. I was out of options, with only one saving grace — willingness. So I (quite reluctantly) released my resistance. I let go of logic. I opened myself to possibilities beyond the rational, to something perhaps entirely unknowable. And in so doing, my life didn’t just change, it transformed wholesale — dramatically and irrevocably improving every aspect of my mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being.I wish I could tell you that from that day forward I devoted myself to a daily meditation practice.That didn’t happen.Newly sober, life quickly got better. Priorities rearranged, and that willingness to surrender — the one character trait that had saved me — started to wane until the very thing that had been so indisputably beneficial to my overall sense of self had been relegated to back seat status — a convenient tool relied upon only when life got complicated, but hardly a consistent mainstay. Despite great appreciation for the benefits of meditation, consistency and momentum eluded me. For many years, I would practice only in spurts as a last ditch salve to alleviate some form of emotional pain.Then about six months ago, I discovered Headspace— a mobile app and digital platform (boasting over 1 million users) pre-packaged with an endless rotation of very accessible, secular guided meditation programs all pleasantly voiced by the company’s founder and today’s guest, Andy Puddicombe.Considered  “the international poster boy for the modern mindfulness movement,”  Andy is a meditation expert, accomplished presenter and author of two books —  Get Some Headspace* and The Headspace Diet*,  both of which have been translated into a zillion languages. An exceptional orator who has successfully popularized concepts traditionally erudite and ethereal, it’s fair to say that he is doing for meditation what Jamie Oliver did for food:  democratizing it.Andy has been featured widely in international press, appearing in Vogue, the New York Times, The Financial Times, Entrepreneur, Men’s Health and Esquire, to name but a few. He’s also no stranger to television and internet fame, having been featured on BBC, Dr Oz, Netflix and TED. In fact, Andy’s TED Talk is a super entertaining must view with almost 5 million views to date.I can’t specify exactly why, but Headspace hit the spot for me. Maybe it’s the ease of use. Maybe it’s because it’s always at my fingertips. Maybe it’s Andy’s soothing, accessible delivery. Then again, maybe the old adage is true:When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.All I can say for certain is that Headspace has helped me re-engage my practice with new enthusiasm, resulting in increased consistency, momentum and of course results. The last six months of my life have been my best — and that is not a coincidence.Therefore, on a personal level, it was a thrill to connect with the man himself — a thoughtful conversation that delves deep into the power of these practices as well as Andy’s quite fantastical personal story. A story that involves dropping out of university in his early twenties to study meditation in the Himalayas, followed by a ten year journey which took him around the world, culminating with ordination as a Tibetan Buddhist monk in Northern India. Prepared to live out the rest of his days in relative seclusion, one day Andy awoke with an epiphany: a yearning to return West and share his experience with the world.Andy’s transition back to lay life in 2004 was no less extraordinary. Training briefly at Moscow State Circus, he returned to London where he completed a degree in Circus Arts with the Conservatoire of Dance and Drama, whilst drawing up the early plans for what was later to become Headspace. The rest is history.From monk to millionaire, Andy is indeed the post-modern mashup of Hesse’s Siddhartha meets Paramahansa Yogananda — the man who first introduced yoga to the West in the 1920’s.I sincerely hope you enjoy the story of a most remarkable man and most unlikely entrepreneur.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Everybody has something to share.

I absolutely love this format, primarily because it connects me more deeply and authentically with the global community of people who enjoy the show. Because community is truly what it’s all about.This is an exciting time for us. We have been working super hard getting everything ready for the impending release of  The Plantpower Way,  so we thought it would be fun to share a little behind the scenes on why we wrote the book; the collaborative and often intense two-year process undertaken to create it; the insane amount of effort and diligence required to launch a book into the mainstream; and our ultimate aspirations for the work.Then the conversation turns to listener submitted inquiries. A conversation that explores:It was really fun to once again sit down with Julie — my wife and co-collaborator — to engage with the audience first hand, hashing out free-form the subjects you care about most.

April 12, 2015

“Outside of an emergency medical condition that requires an urgent intervention, I have never seen anything come close to providing the breadth and depth of benefits that the plant-based lifestyle offers.”Robert Ostfeld, MDNewsflash: heart disease is still America’s #1 killer.Despite groundswell interest in all things wellness, the incidence of atherosclerotic disease is at an all-time high. One out of every two people in the United States will suffer some form of cardiac ailment. And one out of every three people will actually die of heart disease. Meanwhile, we are exporting the standard American diet overseas like it’s the next blockbuster installment of The Avengers. The result? The developing world is now facing rates of lifestyle-related illness unprecedented in the history of humankind.This is a disaster.The great irony of course is that 80-90% of chronic illnesses like atherosclerosis, type-2 diabetes and obesity are preventible and oftentimes even reversible via simple diet and lifestyle alterations.I can preach all day, but to truly capture the attention of the mainstream, catalyze seismic cultural change and put an end to avoidable disease, we desperately need more highly qualified medical professionals who understand the complicated mechanisms that lead to these diseases and are compelled to implement the preventive measures required to combat and avoid them.This is where cardiologist Robert Ostfeld, MD comes in.A summa cum laude graduate of the University of Pennsylvania with a medical degree from Yale and a Masters in Epidemiology from Harvard, Dr. Ostfeld did his internship and residency at prestigious Massachusetts General Hospital and his cardiology fellowship and research fellowship in Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital – both teaching hospitals of Harvard Medical School.An insanely smart dude with mad skills and a bulletproof resume, Robert had his pick of the litter when it came to choosing where to hang his professional hat. Most would have chosen the highest paying, most coveted cardiology department in the country. But this guy had different plans. Instead, Robert headed north of Manhattan to The Bronx to work with underprivileged populations at Montefiore Hospital, while also serving as Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.That right there says a lot about what kind of guy Robert is. But there’s more to the story.Despite training with the best at Yale and Harvard, Robert was nonetheless left with little understanding when it came to nutrition. For years thereafter, he applied evidence-based medicine, recommended a “healthier” lifestyle (which typically included a Mediterranean-style diet), and watched somewhat helplessly as his patients’ diseases all too often progressed. Frustrated and dissatisfied with his patients’ consistent inability to achieve true health, he started to search for alternative means of combating chronic disease.This search led him to  The China Study* by T. Colin Campbell;  Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease*,  by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn; and the documentary Forks Over Knives*— all of which irrevocably altered his medical world view. A thought:What if I really invest myself in the lives of my patients beyond the prescription pad?So he did, a journey that ultimately led to founding and directing the  Montefiore Cardiac Wellness Program  — an immersive, holistic, preventive, team-based approach to patient care that promotes a whole-foods, plant-based diet and intensive lifestyle habit accountability. A program that changed everything for both Robert and his patients.The results of Dr. Ostfeld’s epiphany have been nothing short of extraordinary, radically and permanently improving the health and wellness of thousands. Patient tears of joy abound, buttressing a renewed love for the practice of medicine.The stories are profound and many.  So I am thrilled that my sagacious and quite perspicacious friend took the time to sit down with me in New York so that I can share his powerful insights and experience with you today.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“The calculus of aging offers us two options: We can live a shorter life with more years of disability, or we can live the longest possible life with the fewest bad years. As my centenarian friends showed me, the choice is largely up to us.”Dan BuettnerSomewhere along the way, you’ve likely heard of something called the Blue Zones — a term coined in reference to five hidden slivers of the world that boast the highest per capita populations of centenarians – people who thrive to 100 and beyond. Unlikely locales were people not only live inordinately long, but also seem resoundingly happier than their fellow western world equals.Places where people forgot to die.This is the work of my friend  Dan Buettner.A renaissance man in the truest sense, Dan transcends categorization. Global adventurer. Three-time Guinness Book world record holding endurance cyclist. National Geographic Fellow. Multiple New York Times bestselling author. A wellness and longevity superhero, Dan has keynoted speeches for Bill Clinton’s Health Matters Initiative, Google Zeitgeist, and TEDMED.  He’s appeared on Oprah twice and his TED Talk “How to live to be 100+” has been viewed over 2 million times.Without mincing words, Dan is my hero. A man who exudes life. A man with huge vision. And a man whose life work has positively, permanently and quite unequivocally improved the well being of millions.You might have caught Dan on  The TODAY Show (which is featuring segments on Dan and his work throughout the week),  read about him in last Sunday’s PARADE magazine,  seen him on NBC News  or caught him on  CNN’s The Wonder List a few weeks ago. The common theme of these stories? Grappling with the lifestyle tenets that govern Blue Zone cultures as a means to help the rest of us live longer and better.
According to Dan, Blue Zone cultures extending wellness into Ponce De Leon territory all live in accordance with 9 identifiable, convergent lifestyle principles (listed in the show notes below). Principles that are replicable on both the individual and civic level, as demonstrated by Dan’s Blue Zones Project— a community well-being improvement initiative that has wholly transformed 20 cities and municipalities to date by implementing permanent changes to environment, policy, and social networks that make healthy choices easier.The Blue Zones Solution*,  Dan’s new book out this week, is a highly detailed primer that extrapolates from these principles powerful eating and lifestyle tools to transform your health. Buttressed with highly entertaining stories from Dan’s travels, I highly recommend checking it out – I was lucky enough to get an advance copy, and it’s a terrific read.This is a phenomenal conversation that explores Dan’s new book, the aforementioned principles and what this means for you – how we can all implement certain lifestyle tenets to live longer and, most importantly, get the absolute most out of our years.Beyond the Blue Zone universe, I tackle the story of the man behind the vision. A story that begins with Dan’s improbable encounter with the singular  George Plimpton (lion of The Paris Review  and another personal hero of mine) — a visionary man who catalyzed Dan’s purposeful life with one simple, yet powerful idea:Above all, invest in adventure.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

420,Gene Baur,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/genebaur/,"Episode 138
April 5, 2015

“This lifestyle is not about deprivation. It’s about living inspired.”Gene BaurWe are all born compassionate. And we carry this powerful, inherent trait through adulthood. But often this deeply ingrained impulse becomes repressed — quelled by childhood trauma; eroded by social constraints; overwhelmed by the harried gestalt of daily life and the denial that accompanies our compulsion for convenience and immediate gratification.Today’s guest is a powerful reminder of who we really are. A call to action to better align this core value of compassion with the countless choices we make daily that dictate how we live our lives. To be more mindful about not only what we what eat, but what we do; the hows and whys behind our behavior; and the implications of personal choice on both ourselves and the world at large.How to describe my friend Gene Baur?  Hailed as the “conscience of the food movement” by TIME magazine, this is a guy who has spent the last 25 years traveling extensively around the country, campaigning to raise awareness about the abuses of industrialized factory farming and our current food system. Humanitarian, environmentalist, activist, undercover investigator and best-selling author, Gene is most well known as the president & co-founder of Farm Sanctuary.  The first animal rescue organization dedicated to farmed animals, Farm Sanctuary shelters in New York and California provide rescue, refuge, and adoption for hundreds of farm animals each year, enabling visitors to connect with farm animals as emotional, intelligent individuals. Gene believes these animals stand as ambassadors for the billions on factory farms who have no voice, and he has dedicated his career to advocating on their behalf.He’s so handsome it makes me jealous, yet I can’t help but love everything about this guy. He’s a beautiful soul. And he’s a darn good plant-based marathon runner & ironman athlete to boot.Now for some context. This show is no stranger to people with strong points of view. But Gene was the first true animal rights activist I interviewed (in case you missed it, you can listen to our premier conversation from June 2013 here.  I’m the first to admit that my original reasons for going vegan were far more selfish than ethical. Understanding that animal rights isn’t exactly everyone’s cup of tea, I admit to having some trepidation about publishing that interview.But that was 2013. In truth, that conversation changed me. Gene really disarmed what I would consider willful blindness when it came to so many facets regarding how our world functions. Today I have a very different lens on the issues that spark Gene’s passion. Today, I can’t imagine not sharing Gene’s perspective.For me this marks personal growth. The evolution-revolution that is the hallmark of this journey I undertook eight years ago. Because the more educated I become about how our food system actually functions to deliver meals to our plates, the more interested and outspoken I have become about advocating for change. And the more strident and diligent I have become about aligning my daily personal decisions and consumer choices with a more compassionate and communitarian set of core values.Understand that I take no moral high ground. I’m deeply flawed. But as my awareness continues to broaden, I feel a certain imperative to cast light on the ills of factory farming; the powerfully deceptive marketing tactics that drive unhealthy and inhumane consumer habits; and the extraordinary lengths to which BigFood and their adjuncts on Capitol Hill will go to keep the public blind to the harsh systemic realities of industrialized animal agriculture.Our current system is an environmental disaster. It’s a health care abomination. It’s inarguably unsustainable. And it’s exceedingly cruel to the animals with whom we share this planet.There is a better way. And Gene is a great ambassador of a worthy message warranting our objective attention.This is a great conversation that spans:Gene shares his experiences in his aptly titled new book,  Living The Farm Sanctuary Life*,  a cookbook & lifestyle guide (sound familiar?) oriented around the aforementioned 5 tenets that advocates for a more principled, harmonious, mindful and compassionate approach to living and eating in harmony with nature and your values. It’s a beautiful book and I highly suggest you check it out.If you come to this interview with a difference of opinion, that’s fine. I get it. I ask only that you please listen with an open mind.I sincerely hope you enjoy the offering.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

March 26, 2015

“Realizing that we can actually live with a lot less, combined with the fact that we are capable of more than we can possibly imagine, is actually one of the most powerful things.”Robin ArzónI’m really excited to have Robin Arzón back on the show this week. From corporate lawyer to ambassador of sweat and swagger, Robin brings the heat with unique personal style and an unwavering confidence that is matched only by her unlimited vivaciousness. In the event you missed it, I highly recommend going back and listening to our first conversation, RRP #99.  You also might want to go back and read (or re-read) the blog post I wrote for that one, because it’s kind of awesome.Longtime listeners know Robin is all about story. The power of story. How to properly own your story. How to properly tell your story. The capacity for story to catalyze positive change in others. And the capability we all inherently have to let go of whatever negative story we tell ourselves about ourselves — and instead form an entirely new one.To recap, only three years ago Robin was living a completely different life — toiling away as a corporate lawyer at one of the world’s most prestigious law firms. But a near-death experience being held hostage at gunpoint several years prior gave her the courage to not only begin a new chapter of her life, but to — you guessed it — tell an entirely new story about herself.Robin jumped out on her secure career without a parachute, soared on faith arms spread wide and glided down to a graceful landing on the downtown streets of lower Manhattan like a glorious bird of prey clad in blinding color and a pair of chartreuse running shoes.How do you describe someone who defies definition itself? Robin is so many things I struggle to find words to capture a spirit that can only be properly understood by experiencing her first hand. Nonetheless, I’ll give it a shot. Today Robin is a NYC-based urban, bridge-running force of nature; an accomplished ultramarathoner (she once ran 5 marathons in 5 days across Utah); a running coach; a cycling instructor; and a consultant to some of the biggest brands in the world, like Nike, Adidas and Puma. Not enough? She’s also a lifestyle entrepreneur as well the co-founder and publisher of a relatively new magazine called UNDO. Where sweat meets culture, it’s a gorgeous, high quality production that can be found worldwide in places like Urban Outfitters.But Robin is not immune from obstacles. About a year ago, she faced a unforeseen new challenge: Type 1 Diabetes. Not one to let her illness limit, let alone define her, Robin navigates this setback with the poised demeanor she meets everything — simply another opportunity to empower and inspire others to get out of their comfort zone and, in Robin’s words:do epic shit.As a father of two little girls, I am inspired by her shining example of positive female empowerment. It gives me hope. And she never fails to put a smile on my face while simultaneously challenging my own preconceptions about what is possible for both myself and others.This conversation picks up where RRP #99 left off, delving further into Robin’s story as we explore:My hope is that Robin empowers you to reframe, own and share the best possible story you can tell about yourself.I’m honored to call Robin my friend and it’s a privilege to share her story more deeply with you today.

March 22, 2015

“The single most important thing you can do as a consumer is change out those 3 or 4 ounces of meat in the center of your plate.”Ethan Brown, CEO of Beyond MeatRight now this spinning land mass we call Earth is host to over 7 billion hungry human mouths to feed. Our current set up for handling this relentless, growing need isn’t just problematic, it’s broken, outdated technology that is making us sick and decimating the planet at an unfathomable rate.If we want to preserve a vibrant planet for future generations, it is imperative we find better, more innovative, more economic, more compassionate, more sustainable ways to sate the population.This is a long way of saying it’s high time for a paradigm shift.If you listened to my podcast with Kip Anderson and Keegan Kuhn – the guys behind the highly compelling documentary Cowspiracy  (I implore you to check out both the podcast and the film if you haven’t already), then you already know that industrialized animal agriculture is our #1 environmental threat — far more deleterious to planetary health than transportation or fracking and the current leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution and habitat destruction.Adopting a plant-based diet is the single most powerful thing we can do as consumers to take a stand against this insanity. But to truly solve this problem we need to first acknowledge that we have a serious protein fixation. Facilitating a mass cultural shift away from our strong preference towards an animal-centric diet requires more than a simple plea to go vegan. To truly break the paradigm we need phenomenal food alternatives with mainstream appeal. Products that aren’t just more sustainable and consciously harvested, but inventive products that rival, if not altogether outdo our appetite for beef, chicken, fish and eggs in not just nutritional content, but in flavor, taste and texture as well.The good news is that there are super intelligent, highly motivated people hard at work on just this — innovating brand new ways to improve human health, positively impact climate change, address global resource constraints and improve animal welfare with products, which for lack of a better phrase, simply taste good.Ethan Brown is one such innovator.Conceived in 2009 as a potential solution to problems he saw with the meat industry, Ethan founded Beyond Meat with a singular goal — to produce plant-based food products that would essentially replicate meat in an effort to render some of the downsides of the meat industry obsolete.In the same way last week’s podcast guest Joshua Katcher  implicitly understands that ethically manufactured garments must outmatch their less sustainable comparisons in fashion flair, Ethan understands that to win mainstream hearts and minds, his food products need more than satisfy the palates of enthusiastic carnivores.Backed by heavy hitters like Bill Gates and Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, it’s not a stretch to say Ethan is well on his way to achieving this goal. Food impresario Alton Brown called Beyond Meat’s Chicken Strips  “more like meat than anything I’ve ever seen that wasn’t meat.” Legendary New York Times food columnist Mark Bittman allegedly couldn’t tell the difference between Ethan’s product and the real thing. And Beyond Meat’s newest Beast Burger offering tastes remarkably good while also boasting more protein and iron than beef, more omegas than salmon and plenty of calcium, antioxidants and vitamin B.A disclaimer — I’m a whole food plant-based guy. I’ve never been a big fan of so-called “fake meat” products, most of which are rife with gluten and less than healthy preservatives. However, I recognize the crucial importance of forward thinking, tech style innovation in this space, particularly when it comes to the Herculean task of recruiting dubious tofu-phobic naysayers to the appeal of plant-based alternatives.I won’t say the products are perfect. Ethan’s the first to acknowledge they’re not. It’s an ongoing development process. But they do taste pretty darn good.There is great power in the attempt to disrupt our highly flawed food system from the inside out. I have great respect for what Ethan is trying to accomplish. So I was pumped to visit his facility in El Segundo to learn more about his mission.This is a great discussion — a conversation that not only tackles the ills of our current food system and how we can forge a better way but also a fascinating look into the entrepreneurship required to steward a compelling idea into a reality that just might change the world.I sincerely hope you enjoy the offering.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“Being morally correct rarely overcomes the perceived correctness of beauty.”Joshua KatcherWe talk quite often about food on this podcast — particularly the health, environmental and ethical implications our collective dietary choices and the global impact of the industrialized food industry on the same.But you might be less consciously aware of the massive extent to which the garment industry impacts a wide range of concerns from global climate change to animal welfare to ethics and beyond.Fashion is a world that desperately needs an environmentally conscious, sustainability-focused and ethically driven facelift. A world I wanted to know more about. Irrespective of whether you are an avid reader of Vogue or favor dad jeans, this is a world that merits our attention.To learn more, I sat down with professor, fashion designer, and blogger Joshua Katcher— the founder & creative director behind the sustainable, ethically conscious high-end fashion line Brave GentleMan and the founder of The Discerning Brute – a men’s lifestyle website that focuses on fashion, food, etiquette and ethics profiling creative-influencers who want to redesign the world, redefine success, and look good doing it. Joshua is also a public lecturer and adjunct professor of fashion at Parsons The New School, where his research focuses on sustainability and ethics in fashion production.This conversation offers a quite revealing and at times uncomfortable look at the truth behind exactly how most clothes are manufactured, distributed and marketed to drive consumer purchasing trends. It’s not pretty. But there is a solution. Joshua and his work is part of that solution — leveraging forward-thinking, modern textiles and progressive, business practices that embrace fashion and aesthetics to bring consumers beautiful, better and quite honestly, more ethically imagined and manufactured garments for us to enjoy.This is a really interesting talk about:Highly intelligent, hyper-articulate and of course always bespoke, Joshua is an outstanding ambassador and aesthete of modern fashion modalities, not to mention badass at CrossFit to boot. It’s my honor to share my friend Joshua’s message and experience with you and my hope is that you will come away from this conversation more enlightened and educated when it comes to aligning your consumerism with your values. I did.Even if fashion is not your thing, trust me.

“The thing I really learned was that the difference between the people who made it and the people who didn’t make it had nothing at all to do with fitness. It had purely to do with the belief that they thought they were going to make it.”Jennifer SteinmanFuturist and science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke famously said, the only way to find the limits of the possible is by going beyond them to the impossible. An apropos theme for my conversation with Jennifer Steinman, a documentary filmmaker who spent well over a year following four seemingly normal, far from professional athletes as they prepare for and undertake one of the most grueling, backbreaking endurance challenges on the planet — a collection of ultra-distance adventure footraces teetering on the absurd dubbed the 4 Desert Series.Named by TIME magazine as one of the world’s Top 10 Endurance Competitions, the 4 Deserts  is the world’s leading rough-country endurance footrace series. A unique collection of world-class events that take place over 7 days and 250 kilometers in the largest and most forbidding deserts on the planet.Jennifer has a more poetic take on this lunatic fringe:Imagine you’ve been dropped off in the middle of one of the largest, driest deserts in the World. Over the next six days you will have to run, jog, walk or crawl 155 miles through incessant heat, across soft sand and hard-packed gravel, over sand dunes multiple stories high and down razor-sharp rocky cliffs. You must do this carrying everything you need to survive — clothes, food, sunscreen, emergency medical supplies, sleeping bag — in a 20-pound pack on your back.Now imagine doing this not just once, but four times in one calendar year, through the driest, windiest, hottest, coldest and ultimately the most treacherous four deserts in the world: the Atacama Desert in Chile, the Gobi Desert in China, the Sahara in Egypt … and then, the final stage, a 150-mile footrace across the single most inhospitable landscape in the world: The Last Desert in Antarctica.Any single race in RacingThePlanet’s 4Desert Ultramarathon Series is an extraordinary, life-threatening challenge– something we would only expect the most accomplished, elite athletes on the planet to try. But most of the courageous men and women who come from all over the world to compete in these Herculean events are not professional athletes at all, they’re ordinary people—people with families and day jobs and mortgage payments– people like you and me who have decided, for a variety of personal reasons, to take on this extreme physical challenge.Why do they do it?This week’s guest set out to answer this question. The result is Desert Runners— a feature length character-driven documentary that follows a remarkable collection of brave souls on an extraordinary year-long adventure, racing to the four corners of the Earth.This is a conversation about:Even if you don’t care about ultra-marathon running, this is a valuable exchange well worth your time. Because if you think about it, everybody is an ultramarathoner. I don’t care if you have never run a single mile. Life is the ultimate ultramarathon.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

March 1, 2015

“Everybody wants to be healthy. And I sense a shift in the status quo. People are re-evaluating lifestyle priorities. Looking for more sustainable, ecologically responsible, value-based and wellness oriented ways of living. We just need more family examples.”Julie PiattLet’s talk about food. Despite all the diet and nutrition content I consistently and freely generate, Julie and I are still inundated daily with inquiries like:So what exactly do you guys eat?
How can I get my kids to make healthier choices?
Is it possible to eat healthy on a budget?
How can I overcome my cravings for unhealthy foods?
And of course…Where do you get your protein?It’s questions like these that led to an epiphany: I think it’s time for the next book.A cookbook.However, there is is no shortage of amazing plant-based cookbooks already available. What could Julie and I possibly bring to this conversation that hasn’t already been said?After pouring through all the cookbooks at our local Barnes & Noble, we made a rather shocking discovery — not a single plant-based cookbook seemed to speak directly to the primary concerns of the typical modern family.So we started to think about how we could fill this gap by providing real, tangible guidance for the soccer moms and softball playing dads with young kids just looking to live a little healthier. Normal people searching for a simple, solid roadmap to make better choices at the market and in the kitchen. A book that would really address the true needs of everyday, budget-conscious folks too busy to study nutrition yet seeking easy-to-implement answers. A book that would guide, educate and inspire people to adopt healthier eating and lifestyle habits and instill such habits in their children.Visualizing such a book was easy. Because it’s just a natural, authentic extension of our every day family lifestyle. A lifestyle we call  The Plantpower Way.It’s taken more than two years of solid focused work to get this book right. So this week Julie and I thought it would be fun sit down and learn more about her personal journey in food while rehashing the long journey undertaken to finally birth this book to life.Everybody deserves optimal health. And wellness begins with what we put on our plate. But that’s just the beginning. So we decided to pick up where every other cookbook leaves off by providing concrete tools, tips and general lifestyle guidance to foster long-term wellness and catalyze your journey towards unlocking your best, most authentic self.Bursting with inspiration, practical guidance, and beautiful food and lifestyle photography,  The Plantpower Way  features more than 120 of Julie’s delicious, easy-to-prepare whole food recipes, certain to delight even the most finicky or carnivorous of your clan.But this is more than a mere cookbook. It’s a fully formed, comprehensive lifestyle primer chock-a-block with information, tools, resources and inspiration to not only answer all those questions we field daily, but elevate and guide the modern family towards healthier, more sustainable food, lifestyle and parenting practices. Both evolutionary and revolutionary, it’s a book you will proudly use every day, share with colleagues, eagerly gift family members and even display on your coffee table for friends to peruse and enjoy.Although the book doesn’t hit stores until April 28, it is currently available for pre-order. The way publishing works, pre-orders are very important in terms of setting up the book for long-term success. The number of units sold during the pre-order window count towards first week sales. These numbers influence retail buyer habits (i.e., how many copies of the book your local Barnes & Noble decides to order) and are used to compile bestseller lists. In other words, this is an important time, and quite frankly we really need your help.Towards this end,  we have put together an incredible array of premium pre-order bonus giveaways valued at over $300,000.00 . Tons of amazing products from our good friends at great companies (see below show notes). If for no other reason than appreciation for all the free content I have provided over the years, we would love it if you took a leap of faith and pre-ordered the book (a $29 investment that will yield over $75 in value). Better yet? Pre-order a whole bunch of books, reap the bonus rewards and give the books out as gifts. And while you’re at it, take a quick moment to spread the word about our bonus offers with your friends and on social media.But please understand one thing: — we are not trying to get you to buy something you don’t want. These gifts are our way of giving back. Our way of saying thank you. Seriously and sincerely, thank you for taking this journey with us. Thank you for being the highly engaged and passionate audience that you are. And thank you for shepherding this Plantpower revolution beyond the realm of my imagination.In other words, this is not about me. It’s about the movement. And the movement is everything.Right now the U.S. is in the midst of an almost unspeakable health care and environmental crisis. Heart disease, obesity and diabetes are killing people by the millions and incidence is on the rise. Meanwhile, animal agriculture is depleting our soil, destroying our oceans, devastating our rainforests and creating more green house gas emissions than all of transportation combined. Our systems of food production and health care are simply not sustainable. We’re running out of time. The insanity must stop.Despite this rather grim reality, the solution has been staring us in the face all along. The simple inescapable truth is that 80-90% of chronic illness is preventible or reversible via a whole food plant-based lifestyle. A lifestyle choice that will render your health bulletproof to western disease and impact the environment more positively than any other single decision or act you will take for the rest of your life. The Plantpower Way is our contribution to this solution. A book we know holds the power to change lives. We just need your help getting it out there.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

February 20, 2015

“I’m not a challenged athlete, I’m an athlete with challenges…there’s a big difference.”Matt LongIn 2005, New York City firefighter, avid marathoner and ironman athlete Matt Long hopped onto his bike to do what he did every day — ride from his East side Manhattan apartment north to the Randall’s Island fire academy where he helped train the city’s bravest. As he crossed 52nd Street, a 20-ton bus made a right turn from the middle lane. The bus didn’t just hit him, it dragged his body completely underneath, where Matt was then quite literally impaled by his bike.After receiving 68 units of blood in the first 40 hours post-accident, Matt spent the next month in a coma.When he woke up, the doctors told him he was facing a one percent chance of survival.Matt had other plans.After a 5-month hospital stint and 40 surgeries in under two years, he did more than survive. He finally came alive.The story of Matt’s accident and his comeback quest to tackle the 2008 NYC marathon just 3 years after his accident was first chronicled in an extraordinary story in Runner’s World  by Charles Butler entitled  A Second Life. That story was later adapted and expanded into Matt’s exceptionally inspiring memoir,  The Long Run* , a work of co-authorship by Long and Butler (not to be confused with my buddy and RRP favorite Mishka Shubaly’s equally compelling Kindle Single, also entitled  The Long Run*).Today Matt will tell you not only does he not regret the accident, it is the one thing that has made him whole.There are many words that can be used to describe Matt — firefighter, 9/11 first responder, ironman athlete, accomplished marathoner, advocate, bon vivant, husband and father. But one word will suffice: hero.Matt is a man I hold in high regard as an incredible example of the resiliency not just of the physical body, but of the emotional body — the indomitable, boundless strength of the human spirit in selfless service to others.Great guy. Great talk.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

“There’s a lot of ways to succeed and you don’t always know what’s going to make you happiest — what’s the most fulfilling — if you can’t get past your ego and your own idea of what you’re supposed to be.”Jason Hall, Oscar-Nominated Screenwriter of “American Sniper”Jason Hall is having a moment. The country is having a moment.Although hardly an overnight success story, it’s fair to say American Sniper is this talented screenwriter’s big break. A break so big he just might win his first Oscar a few days from today. But the celebratory mood is tempered by one inescapable fact: it is constructed from the tragic demise of a man named Chris Kyle. The soldier who not only serves as this contentious movie’s protagonist, but was also a man Jason called friend.In an era when studios shy away from war movies as box office poison, American Sniper is an unsuspecting juggernaut. Breaking records left and right, the Bradley Cooper starrer seems to have touched a national nerve, packing theatres across the U.S. to the tune of over $300 million domestically and a fast approaching $400 million worldwide gross. Not only is American Sniper Clint Eastwood’s most successful film to date, it’s the highest grossing war film of all time.And yet the film is not without its critics and controversy. Propaganda or protest movie? War polemic or character study? The glorification of a highly skilled killer or the tragic tale of one man’s demise? Let the pundits pontificate, Jason Hall would say. The important thing is that people are now talking about things that need talking about.Irrespective of your personal feelings about this film, you cannot deny that it is a work that demands to be reckoned with. A reckoning that has catalyzed a productive dialog around a litany of important issues such as:This is the dialog that interests Jason – a guy with his feet on the ground who really gets that the success of this movie is not about him. It’s about service. It’s about the responsibility we collectively shoulder as a society – irrespective of politics — to do a much better job of taking proper care of the men and women who voluntarily enlist to place their lives on the line daily, and without reservation.This is a compelling conversation about many things, from the machinations of Hollywood to the fragility of life. But to me, this is about the responsibility to make your journey about something bigger and more important than your self and your ego.I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.Peace + Plants,Listen & Subscribe on  iTunes  |  Soundcloud  |  Stitcher  |  TuneIn Thank you to this week’s show sponsors:Production, music & sound design by Tyler Piatt. Additional production by Chris Swan.

February 8, 2015

“The moral standard isn’t always scientifically sound.”Vani HariRemember that big deal about how the bread at Subway contains chemicals found in yoga mats?Then there was the story about how fast food French fries contain a chemical used in Silly Putty. And the whole to-do about how there’s actually no pumpkin in the Starbucks pumpkin latte.The person behind these semi-salacious, headline grabbing campaigns is this week’s guest, Vani Hari – aka Food Babe – the outspoken and often divisive food activist behind the wildly popular FoodBabe.com blog.I met Vani at a dinner party this past summer and found her not only delightful but also razor sharp, fiercely passionate and tenacious when the subject turned to food — particularly what big food manufacturers don’t want you to know about what’s in our food. Her message? To empower the typical soccer mom with the information to feed her family right and the courage to stand up for greater transparency and accountability from companies that produce what ends up on our plates.FoodBabe.com, which exceeds an astounding 2.5 million unique visitors per month,  along with the mobilization of Vani’s passionate Food Babe Army following, has been incredibly successful in getting gigantic companies like Subway, Kraft, Chipotle, Chick-fil-A, and even Anheuser-Busch to not only remove certain harmful ingredients from their food but also steer them toward more healthful policies.Therefore, it should come as no surprise that food companies are terrified of her. Her voice and legion of supporters pose a significant threat to corporate profits and business as usual. This makes her a target. Attacked daily, it’s not uncommon for her to receive death threats. But that’s what happens when you really put yourself out there, on the front lines.The fact that she soldiers on is super ballsy. She is a warrior. Totally punk rock. The Erin Brockovitch of food.Congressman Tim Ryan calls her Vani “a one woman consumer protection agency.” And I for one have tremendous respect for anyone who demonstrates her level of courage and advocacy.Vani and I were supposed to sit down in person in New York a couple weeks ago but the big storm that never was left her with a cancelled flight and compelled me to break my cardinal rule and host this conversation on Skype. I never do this, but I think Vani’s message is potent and important and it didn’t appear we would be in the same city at the same  time again anytime soon, so I took a chance and I’m glad I did.This is a great talk. A talk about how all of us, irrespective of our personal dietary proclivities, can live a cleaner, more organic and healthier lifestyle in today’s overprocessed, contaminated-food world.This is a talk about corporate responsibility and corporate transparency.This is a talk about government oversight and regulation of our food, our food companies, and the ingredients that find their way into our food.And most importantly, from my perspective, this is a talk about the inherent power and responsibility we hold as as consumers to be advocates; to raise our voice and be heard; to hold the people behind the food we eat more accountable for how its made and what goes into it.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

February 1, 2015

America’s #1 killer, heart disease currently kills 1 out of every 3 Americans; 70% of Americans are obese and getting fatter; and Studies forecast that by 2030, 50% of Americans will be diabetic or pre-diabetic.The great irony in all of this is that, as Dr. Kahn so astutely points out, 80-90% of all chronic health problems can be resolved via pretty simple diet and lifestyle alternations.The tricky part is translating these lifestyle alterations from theory to practice. I understand that it can be difficult for many, particularly when there is so much confusing information out there concerning about heath, nutrition and diet. So confusing in fact, that it becomes incredibly challenging for even the most savvy consumer to separate fact from fiction and truth from hyperbole.Just because good news about bad habits makes for tempting clickbait doesn’t mean the information is reliable — its usually not.To help sift through all of this, I once again sit down for a heart to heart (pun intended) with cardiologist Joel Kahn, MD — you can listen to our first conversation (RRP #44) here.A Summa Cum Laude graduate of the University of Michigan’s prestigious Inteflex program (a 6-year undergraduate / graduate program that developed doctors fresh out of high school), Joel has served as Clinical Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at Wayne State University School of Medicine since 1993. He’s authored over 130 articles on heart disease, is a frequent lecturer on heart disease and its prevention, has performed thousands of cardiac procedures, and has been advising patients on heart healthy programs for over 20 years.Not only does Dr. Kahn know what he is talking about, his basic message is elementary: if you want to experience true long-term wellness, then you must focus on implementing sustainable long-term preventive protocols into your lifestyle. This starts and ends with diet and active lifestyle.The specific thrust of this conversation focuses on separating truth from marketing with respect to certain zeitgeist trends in nutrition science. To wit:Is butter really back?
What are the health impacts of a low carb / high fat diet?
What are the risks (and benefits, if any) of trendy practices like putting butter and oil in your morning coffee?
Is everything we thought we knew about saturated fat truly wrong?
Who was Ancel Keys and what is the import of his nutritional studies?
What is the true impact of dietary cholesterol on arterial and heart health?Finally, and most importantly, what specific dietary and lifestyle protocols does this veteran cardiologist recommend to maintain optimal heart health in a culture in which heart disease has become a wildly out of control pandemic?You’ll want to tune in to find out.Amazingly informative, this is straight talk from a solid guy. An awesome and trusted and educated and experienced and entertaining guy I am proud to call my friend.I sincerely hope you heed the call and enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

431,Mike Cotty,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/turning-your-passion-into-your-profession-mike-cotty-rrp-127/,"Episode 127
January 25, 2015

What can mined from the abyss that separates ordinary from extraordinary?Although he’s never pedaled a single stage of the Tour de France as a professional cyclist, Mike Cotty has done things on the bike that would make even Jens Voigt (the consensus hard man of the pro peloton) cringe.Here’s a taste. Last summer Mike rode his bike 1000 kilometers non-stop across 21 mountains in the Dolomites, Eastern Alps and Swiss Alps, from Conegliano, Italy, to Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, France. That’s over 21,000 meters in elevation gain. That’s 54 hours of riding without sleep. That’s like riding 8 to 10 stages of the Tour de France without stopping.How is that even humanly possible?Mike also rode 684 kilometers for 30 hours straight across the Pyrenees from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. A feat rivaled only by his 33-hour, 677 kilometer ride that ascended 16,000 meters of elevation gain across the Alps.Obviously I wouldn’t characterize Mike as normal. Far from it. But there is a very relatable everyman aspect to Mike’s story that captured my fancy.Mike’s path has hardly been linear, but today he is not only an extraordinarily accomplished athlete, he is a respected filmmaker, brand ambassador, media & marketing consultant and entrepreneur. Through his company Media-24, Mike creates compelling content and develops marketing strategy for top tier organizations like Mavic, Cannondale and the Cannondale-Garmin professional cycling team. Mike’s latest passion project is The Col Collective, a high quality online video resource dedicated to helping inspire and educate cyclists to reach the summit of the most spectacular mountain passes in the world.Mike’s is also a path without ego, well grounded in a true desire to educate, positively impact and inspire people to overcome their own barriers. All these elements make for great conversation about passion. About pushing past that voice in your head that wants you to quit. About what is required to break through seemingly insurmountable barriers. And about the self-discovery incident to attempting something personally unprecedented.This is a conversation about the value and importance of hard work over the life hack. About the pain, suffering, joy and pride that comes with embracing the journey. About living in balance with nature. About faith, having a strong conviction about yourself and the path ahead. And it’s about what’s required to turn your passion into your profession.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

432,Sam Jones,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/how-to-cultivate-your-authentic-voice-with-sam-jones-rrp-126/,"Episode 126
January 18, 2015

“The road to a good picture is through a lot of bad ones.” – Sam JonesThis week’s episode is a bit of a departure. But like Frost’s road less travelled, it’s a direction well worth pursuing.My podcast was borne from a love of the art of the long form conversation. Authentic expression is a predominant theme of virtually every episode. And I sheepishly admit to a slight obsession with talented people at the nadir of their creativity, expressing their specific life purpose with unapologetic conviction. Sam Jones is the embodiment and ethos of all these ideals and more. Lauded photographer, documentary filmmaker, award winning music video director, magazine publisher, television creator and podcast host. Oh yeah, he’s also married with kids.As a photographer, Sam is the go to guy for top tier magazines such as Vanity Fair, Esquire, Rolling Stone, GQ and Time for creating timeless portraits of luminaries, A-list actors and musicians like Barak Obama, George Clooney, Robert Downey Jr., Bob Dylan, Jack Nicholson and Dave Grohl.All of this is super cool of course. But quite frankly it’s not what motivated me to want to sit down with Sam. What really captivated me about this talented artist is Sam’s newest venture, a multi-media, multi-faceted project he created entitled offCamera.It’s photography. It’s a magazine. It’s a television show. It’s a podcast. It’s journalism. It’s entertainment. It’s art – the art of exquisite portraiture achieved through images, words and conversation.Simply put, Sam performs up close and personal, uninterrupted long-form conversations with today’s most prolific cultural icons – people like Matt Damon, Sarah Silverman, Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, Laura Dern and more. Each conversation is filmed for initial broadcast on DirectTV’s Audience Network and subsequently available on the offCamera website as well as on iTunes as an audio podcast. Accompanied by a formal portrait, the interviews are also reformatted in print to comprise a printed magazine.After listening to Sam’s intimate dialog with Robert Downey Jr., I was left to ponder this question: where else could I possibly listen to (or watch) someone like this converse for a full hour on the particulars of life and art?Nowhere. You can’t. Blame our soundbite obsessed world, but conversations like these are extremely rare if not altogether nonexistent in publicly available form. Complemented by his extraordinary attention to detail and quality, these are all reasons why Sam’s work is such a gift to us all.I have been so moved by offCamera that I felt compelled to turn the mic around, point it at Sam and get to the bottom of his story. Thank you Sam for your willingness to engage me in a dynamic conversation that explores the intersection of art and commerce; the importance of authenticity in the expression of one’s creativity; and what can be learned from working with the most prolific musicians, actors, filmmakers and artists in the world.In the words of Sam,“it has taken me a lifetime to develop my attention span, and I want to use it.”Me too Sam. Me too. I sincerely hope you enjoy the listen.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

January 11, 2015

 “The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will interest her or his patients in the care of the human frame, in a proper diet, and in the cause and prevention of the disease.”Thomas EdisonIf we want to repair our broken health care system and move culture towards true, long-term sustainable wellness, then medicine must embrace a a new approach to healing. An approach that’s so new, it’s old.Less reductive, more holistic.
Less diagnose & prescribe and more all-encompassing, functional and preventive.Let’s kick start that conversation. This week’s guest is nutritionist, acupuncturist, herbalist, Reiki Master and expert Chinese Medicine practitioner  Heather Lounsbury, author of  Fix Your Mood with Food*.Although she gave up meat nearly 30 years ago for ethical reasons, Heather was a junk food vegetarian with zero interest health until hers hit the skids. Moody and constantly fatigued, she began experimenting with nutrition and was astonished to discover the extent to which she could modulate her physical and emotional vitality relative to the types of foods she would eat. This realization lead Heather to pursue graduate degrees in nutrition and Chinese medicine. Today Heather is a well respected clinical practitioner with over a decade of experience treating patients with a wide variety of mental, emotional and physical issues.Her basic message? Live natural. Live well. Food has a far greater impact than we recognize on not only our physical health but on our mental and emotional health as well. Not only can proper diet (amplified by additional holistic healing measures) alleviate stress and elevate your mood naturally, it can prevent and often reverse a wide variety of chronic infirmities, including heart disease, elevated cholesterol, digestive issues, diabetes (diabesity!) and more.Over the course of our conversation we discuss:How pain and digestive disorders can be holistically managed and alleviated;
How holistic healing practices can be used to treat mental health & addiction issues;
The importance of progress over perfection;
The role and function of certain herbs on physiological functions;
Primer and origin of food allergies;
Thoughts on GMO’s, Omega- 3 EFA’s & Supplementation; and
Addressing the social barriers that impede healthy eating.Lots of good stuff to chew on this week. I hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

January 4, 2015

“Most of us are gambling on the biggest risk of all: that one day we can buy the freedom to do what we want later in life.”Jake Ducey What if the path you think you’re meant to be living isn’t your path at all?I grappled with this mental and spiritual Rubik’s cube for decades. Only now — at 48 — do I feel like I have any insight whatsoever into this quandary.Not so with today’s guest. After a drunken car accident at age 19, Jake Ducey had an epiphany: maybe, just maybe, the traditional promise of the American Dream isn’t my path to happiness and personal fulfillment. What did he do with this realization? He up and quit school, walking out on a collegiate basketball scholarship to instead light out and travel the world.Along the way, Jake chronicled his journey, distilling his insights down to a book entitled Into the Wind . Undaunted by being turned down by every publisher, he nonetheless self-published his book. And without any marketing budget or publicist, Jake still managed to self-promote Into the Wind to Amazon’s top 300 – no small accomplishment.Jake subsequently piqued the interest and mentorship of people like  Chicken Soup for the Soul* author Jack Canfield and  Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus* author John Gray. He became a TEDx speaker. And at 23, Jake became the youngest author to land a motivational book publishing deal at a major publishing house (Tarcher/Penguin).The Purpose Principles* – hitting book stores this week — is the product of Jake’s journey to date, drawing on the stories of success, failure, and the common threads among some of today’s most successful and influential people to illuminate a plan for living your best life in a changing world – a theme not inconsistent with this show.I’ve hosted more than a few impressive young and precocious twenty-somethings on the show over the last two years because I love getting the millennial perspective on life. I like young people and as a parent of two teenage boys and two soon to be teenage girls, I truly want to understand what makes the next generation tick. What is important to millennials? What is the lens through which they perceive their environment? And how will this perception frame and shape the world they will soon inherit and steward into the future?But let’s face it – at 48 I’m likely older than Jake’s father. So is there really anything (anything at all?) that this 23 year old (or any 23 year old for that matter) could possibly teach me? Maybe I’m being a snob (probably). But it’s a question worth asking, isn’t it? What kind of insights could such a young person possibly have that would legitimize a book of any legitimate merit or substance?I admit to being more than pleasantly surprised by Jake — his energy, enthusiasm and positivity is infectious. I genuinely enjoyed our conversation. It’s a conversation that gives me hope for a younger generation too often preemptively written off as entitled and lazy. It’s also a conversation that delves into universal subjects all people young and old should be grappling with — how to maximize purpose and personal fulfillment; the importance of self-directed learning; the crucial role of mentorship; how to propel yourself forward in the face of fear; why it’s okay to feel different; why it’s so important to go after your dreams; and why, in the words of Jake himself, purpose is the strongest form of activism.I sincerely hope you enjoy the offering.

December 21, 2014

“Everyday we have the opportunity to create a living masterpiece.”Michael GervaisAt the highest echelons of sport, all the athletes are supremely talented. All have devoted their lives to being the best they can be. All train as hard as they possibly can. And all are optimizing their sleep, nutrition and recovery to glean every extra edge imaginable.So what distinguishes the gold medalist from the also ran?Is it luck? Talent? Support? Resources? Of course every result is significantly influenced by some combination of these important variables. But all things being equal, the athlete with the mental and emotional edge will stand atop the podium every time.Once the embarrassing last stop on a flailing athlete’s career, the world’s top sports psychologists now enjoy a highly influential and respected role proactively honing the mental and emotional edge of today’s most successful athletes, CEOs and creatives looking to elevate peak performance beyond the imaginable.Enter Dr. Michael Gervais– the go to high performance psychologist everyone is talking about.Director of the High Performance Psychology arm of DISC (Diagnostic and Interventional Surgical Center) Sports & Spine Center in Marina Del Rey and a key member of the Red Bull High Performance Program, Michael works in the trenches of high-stakes environments, where there is no luxury for mistakes, hesitation, or failure to respond. With the vision of helping his clients thrive under pressure, Michael has created a performance model — melding state-of-the-art brain mapping techniques with an approach grounded in high-performance psychology — that allows people to achieve their maximum potential, whether on or off the field.Dr. Gervais’ results are staggering. If you follow the NFL, then you might recall Michael as the guy Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll credits as integral in their Super Bowl win for the meditation, mindfulness and other crucial team building techniques  he helped foster and instill into the fabric of the Seahawks organization and team culture that paved the team’s path towards incredible success.You might also remember that Felix Baumgartner’s now-infamous Red Bull Stratos jump from an altitude of 128,000 feet almost never was simply because Felix simply could not overcome the high level of anxiety and claustrophobia he experienced every time he donned the jump suit. It was none other than Gervais who helped Baumagartner resolve the issue and get Stratos back on track. No Gervais, no history making jump.In addition to the Seahawks and Red Bull’s North American athletes, Dr. Gervais has worked with the US Olympic Team, snowboarders, golfers, basketball players, track and field athletes, an impressive array of top collegiate programs, and professional sports organizations including the NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB and UFC. In addition, his work has played an integral role in the US Military, as well as several collegiate and high school programs.While Dr. Gervais’ roster includes some of the sports world’s most elite, this isn’t just about high performance athletes, its about high performance life. To coin his phrase, everyday we have the opportunity to create a living masterpiece. So what’s the secret?The answer might surprise you. It’s not about motivation. And it’s not about winning. It’s about the way it feels to be who you are. It’s about courage. And it’s about exploring what’s possible.I sincerely hope you enjoy this exploration of the boundaries of human potential with the sagacious and insightful Dr. Michael Gervais.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

And now for something completely different…In an effort to create a little more intimacy, a little more community, and a little more connection with you — the audience — I thought I would open the show up to your burning questions. Talk about what you want to talk about for a change. A few weeks back I put the word out for question submissions and you responded — our inbox was flooded with e-mails.So here we are. My first spin with a Q&A format. I picked a handful of queries I thought would make for an interesting and broadly applicable discussion, asked Julie to occupy the co-pilot seat (talking into a microphone alone is really hard, and not that fun) and we gave it our all to answer your questions to the best of our collective abilities.Topics discussed and questions answered pivot around the following:Special thanks and shoutout to Jen B., Tommy F., Pete D., Dawn and Hugh for the great questions. Not sure about whether or not you want to be identified publicly, so I’m going to err on the side of anonymity.Did you guys like the episode? Is this format something you think I should I do it again? Was it too long? Too short? How about rotating guests for co-pilot duty? If the demand exists and I continue to get great submissions from you, then I’ll keep doing it. Maybe not every week, but we’ll see.

IN-Q  returns. It’s time to question everything. It’s time to get excited for now.If you’ve been on this journey with me for a while, no doubt RRP 81  seared Q into your permanent consciousness. If you’re new to the show, I strongly suggest you give that episode a listen first. Not only is it an epic conversation, it will give you some crucial context and foundation for today’s mind meld.Nonetheless, here’s a quick breakdown on the impressive IN-Q curriculum vitae:Rapper. Actor. Teacher. Songwriter, TED Talker & internationally revered spoken word artist, IN-Q is a national poetry slam champion who has shared the stage with people like Barack Obama, De La Soul, Eminem, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, John Legend and even Cirque du Soleil. He has toured over 70 colleges; written songs for Miley Cyrus, Rock Mafia, Selena Gomez and Aloe Blacc and has been featured on virtually every TV network from A&E to ABC, including HBO’s Def Poetry Jam and Versus & Flow.Why is a spoken word poet guesting on a health & wellness podcast?Because wellness isn’t just diet, exercise and yoga mats. Someone who is truly “well” exudes positivity, soul, spirit, honesty, service, selflessness and integrity from their very core. IN-Q represents a life fully expressed – spreading a message of healing, love and positivity in service to others. Not only is IN-Q a man living his most authentic self, he is what I would call the very definition of health.On January 15, for one night only, IN-Q will be performing at the beautiful Mark Taper Forum in downtown Los Angeles. It is going to be an epic evening (I’ll definitely be there), so if you are in town that day I strongly suggest you pick up tickets now — it will definitely sell out and it’s a one time deal not to be missed. For tickets and additional information on this one time performance, go to in-q.com.*If you can’t make the show, then this podcast is the next best thing. IN-Q is a special guy — touched in a very real, tactile way. I aspire to this man’s openness, grace, and attitude of gratitude. It’s an honor to spend time with him and I am so pleased to bring his message to you once again. An incredible storyteller, his message will leave you reevaluating your priorities, rethinking your path and ultimately indelibly changed.As the man himself just might say: get excited for now and question everything.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

December 10, 2014

Welcome back for Part 2 of my conversation with Teen Whisperer Josh Shipp.You haven’t listened to Part 1 yet? Go do that first, then come on back. It will save me some explaining. But as long as we’re on the subject, let’s recap the situation.Josh is a recognized teen behavior expert well known for helping adults understand teens and teens understand themselves. He’s worked with, appeared on and/or contributed to MTV, CNN, FOX, The New York Times, 20/20, Anderson Cooper Live, Oprah.com and Good Morning America. In 2009 Josh was named to Inc. magazine’s “30 Under 30” of successful entrepreneurs. He has lectured at Harvard, Stanford, UCLA and MIT, starred in two documentary-style television series and authored two books: The Teen’s Guide to World Domination  and  Jump Ship.If you did listen to my intro and outro to Part 1, then you know Josh challenged me to remove e-mail and social media from my iPhone as a means of increasing my overall productivity and enhancing the quality of my interpersonal interactions. Today is day 3 and as Josh so adeptly predicts in this second part of our conversation, I am indeed twitchy. A little anxious. Scattered and basically just uncomfortable with the whole idea. Why? Because I like being connected at all times. I like the buzz and anticipation of checking social media. And I can easily justify it as part of my job. But this does not mean it’s healthy because it isn’t. My relationship might not fall into Her (the movie) territory, but it’s definitely obsessive compulsive, if not just a downright addiction.What does this remind me of?Rehab.Weathering a detox — or in this case an iDetox — isn’t fun. But for me it’s familiar territory. I know that if I stick with it, it will pass. I also know that the simple fact I am experiencing withdrawal symptoms is a pretty good indicator that I am onto something. Something I need to do if I want to grow.Monday night I fired an e-mail off to Josh to thank him again for doing the podcast and to let him know Part 1 was live. I closed the note with the following:“P.S. – deleted Twitter, Facebook AND e-mail from my phone. Think I’m going to have a panic attack. Tell me I’ll be OK.”The next morning, Josh replied:“Imagine having Doritos and a green drink sitting in front of you. If you’re new to eating clean … you’ll grab the Doritos every time, even though you know better. But when the ONLY option is the green drink, you are at first forced to go for it, but then later choose it. We should choose real humans, friends, family, etc. first. But social media is the Doritos. As sad as this is, we have slowly trained ourselves to go to real people LAST instead of first… This is a way of reprograming ourselves.”So true. I’ve decided to undergo this #iDetox for me, but I also know I’m not alone. This is for the millions of people out there quietly coveting smart phone addictions that are ultimately degrading the quality of their three dimensional tactile, analog lives. Their real lives. If I can do this, then so can you.iPhone digital detox Day 3: uncomfortable, anxious, confused, disoriented, irritable. Obviously I need this. #iDetox Who’s w/ me?— richroll (@richroll) December 10, 2014Are you in? If so, here’s what I am doing for the next 30 days — I dare you to join me:This is not about quitting social media or becoming some kind of technology luddite. It’s simply about creating healthy boundaries around use. It’s about prioritizing real relationships over virtual ones. And it’s about being more present in the life you are actually living. Let’s treat this like a fun 30 day ride. An experiment undertaken together. If after 30 days we conclude we are happier, more present, and importantly more productive, then together we can assess a long-term strategy and its implications going forward.None of us are perfect. But to echo Josh, it’s these imperfections that make us human. And the pooled, communal humanity is what just might make this collective endeavor highly influential.So let’s tap that Josh Shipp vein once again and pick up the mainline where we left off on Monday. I sincerely hope you enjoy the second part of the conversation and I encourage you to let me know what you think of it and this whole #iDetox experiment in the comments below.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

December 7, 2014

The road gets narrower.In sobriety, this phrase gets tossed around early and often. When I was new to recovery, I had no idea what these words meant. Now I catch myself reprising this mantra daily.Translation: left to my own devices, I will unconsciously and obsessively latch onto and lose myself in almost anything that promises to remove me from myself, take me out of the moment, numb my emotions, undermine my productivity and (preferably) isolate me from other humans — this is alcoholism.If I want to grow, I have to be willing to let go of old habits that no longer serve me. The more sober I get, the more certain seemingly innocuous behaviors become problematic — impediments to accessing the best version of myself. Growth requires that such behaviors constantly be assessed, addressed, modified, and in some cases discarded altogether.For me, drugs and alcohol were obviously the first to go. But the inquiry didn’t end there. When drugs and alcohol were removed from my system, my dis-ease had to find secondary behavioral weaknesses to exploit — things like how I navigate my relationships and intimacy, how I relate to food, and even how I use television.Changing my diet 8 years ago helped me understand the full extent to which I would use food to medicate and regulate my emotional state — something that never previously even occurred to me. Next up was TV – a perfect way to lose myself in “harmless” entertainment and “not feel” whatever I was experiencing emotionally. So a year ago we pulled the plug on DirectTV. This was not my idea. Like giving up drugs or cheeseburgers, this was not something I wanted to do. It was something I needed to do if I wanted to continue evolving. The detox was brutal. But I can tell you now that I would never go back — my life is way better now without the box.The road continues to grow narrower.My latest struggle? Owning up to the obsessive manner in which I use my iPhone to “check out.” What good is all the meditation and mindfulness work I have been doing if every time I have a free moment I impulsively grab my phone and start addictively scrolling through Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and e-mail? Without a doubt, its become my drug of choice. I am finally willing to admit that the compulsive nature of my relationship with my beloved device is not compatible with the man I would like to become. It’s a walk that doesn’t meet my talk. Things have to change.So today — thanks exclusively to my provocative conversation with this week’s amazing guest — I deleted Twitter, Facebook and e-mail from my iPhone.Holy crap. If you know me, then you know this is not a small thing — I damn near live on my phone. The detox already rivals anything I have previously endured. This fact alone validates my decision, does it not? To be clear, I’m not quitting social media — it has been and continues to be a huge and tremendously valuable part of my daily life. What I am doing is taking Josh’s advice (per our conversation) and creating healthy boundaries around my use of these platforms so I can grow. The desired result? Enhanced emotional well being; a reduction in anxiety; an elevation of mindfulness; qualitative improvement in my interpersonal interactions; greater appreciation for the present moment; and last, but hardly least, increased focus and productivity.Enter  Josh Shipp.Abandoned by his birth parents before he even left the hospital. At risk foster kid. Victim of serial abuse. Given up on by countless foster parents. From the get go, the deck was stacked against Josh, and the house always wins. Josh’s future was essentially predestined to be bleak and devoid of opportunity. Then he met someone who cared. Someone who refused to give up on him. Someone who helped transform Josh’s bottomless reserve of hurt and neglect into a channel for helping others. The result was miraculous, lending truth to the story Josh now tells the millions of teens that look to him for advice, insight, inspiration and guidance to take control of their lives:Now widely known as the Teen Whisperer, Josh is a recognized teen behavior expert that helps adults understand teens and teens understand themselves. He’s worked with, appeared on and/or contributed to MTV, CNN, FOX, The New York Times, 20/20, Anderson Cooper Live, Oprah.com and Good Morning America. In 2009 he was named to Inc. magazine’s “30 Under 30” of successful entrepreneurs. Josh has lectured at Harvard, Stanford, UCLA, MIT and other major universities. He has starred in two documentary-style television series, Jump Shipp and Teen Trouble and has authored two books:  The Teen’s Guide to World Domination and  Jump Ship.Heading into this interview I had a feeling Josh and I were going to hit it off. We totally did. We could have talked all day. We totally almost did that too. Therefore, I decided to break this conversation into 2 parts. I’ll post Part 2 late Wednesday night (12.10.14 PST).How did Josh find his way out? What do adults most misunderstand about teens? How can parents better communicate with their adolescents? How do you reach an emotionally withdrawn youth? How does Josh’s life experience inform his own parenting? And how do you inspire a young person who simply feels he or she has nothing to offer?According to Josh, the path from helplessness to empowerment begins with understanding that:What exactly does that mean? Let’s dive into Josh’s universe and find out. This conversation left me not only inspired, but actually compelled to make some important changes in my own life.

443,Dean Karnazes,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-115-dean-karnazes-to-struggle-is-to-be-alive/,"Episode 115
November 30, 2014

Lots of excitement and anticipation about today’s guest. One of the most lauded, celebrated and accomplished athletes on the planet, let me introduce you to the guy who can seemingly run forever: Dean Karnazes.We’re talking about a guy TIME magazine named one of the “Top 100 Most Influential People in the World.” Men’s Fitness magazine hailed him as one of the fittest men on the planet. An internationally recognized endurance athlete, NY Times bestselling author, in demand public speaker, and successful entrepreneur, Dean has pushed his body, mind and spirit to places most people simply cannot fathom.To give you an idea of what Dean is all about, let’s briefly run through a few of his ridiculous mind-bending running accomplishments:Given all of these feats of astounding endurance and more, Dean is widely lauded as one of the greatest athletes of our time — an accolade deserved if you ask me.But it wasn’t alway this way. After success on the track in high school, Dean put running in his rear view in favor of business. But by age 30, he found himself at a spiritual crossroads. Dissatisfied with the successful, comfortable life he had built for himself, he yearned for something more. He yearned for challenge. He yearned for discomfort. He yearned for struggle. Because to struggle is to be alive.After a now famous drunken all night run following his 30th birthday party, the rest is well documented running history. Dean chronicles his discovery and love of running in his bestselling memoir  Ultramarathon Man*— a must read for anyone who loves an inspirational story of adversity and personal triumph — and his journey continues in his follow up tomes  50/50*, and  Run!*  Not enough? Dean is currently hard at work on a new book – a novelized look at the amazing life of Pheidippedes, the legendary Greek who ran from Marathon to Athens to deliver news of a military victory against the Persians, a subject close to Dean’s heart given his Greek heritage.How does Dean do it? Some chalk it up to genetics – a freakishly high lactate threshold; an unnaturally high tolerance for pain; and an unusual ability to tolerate sleep deprivation Setting aside debate on whether these mental and physiological data points are earned or inherited, I feel compelled to say that the answer to this question is far more complex. And far more interesting.I first met Dean very briefly back at a trade show back in 2011. In 2012, he was gracious enough to give me a very kind endorsement blurb for my book  Finding Ultra*. But I can’t honestly say I really knew the man. Then, out of the blue, he sent me short, cryptic email in early 2013:Dean: Any desire to spend a few relaxing days out in Death Valley this summer?Me: Are you asking me what I think you’re asking me?Indeed he was. A formal invite to help support Dean’s 10th assault on the legendary Badwater 135— widely considered the world’s toughest footrace. It was an offer I simply could not refuse.Beyond the honor, it was an extraordinary experience (for my first-hand account, check out my podcast chat with Josh Spector last year – episode #40 ). I have to say I was in over my head on this one – I simply hadn’t been training that much at the time — but I am so grateful for the experience, one I won’t soon forget. Myself, along with Jason Koop, Brendan Freise and Nathan Peerbolt spent 24 hours pacing Dean across Death Valley and up the Mt. Whitney portals. My personal highlight was running alongside Dean through a huge portion of the night straight through to daybreak. Despite the pain he endured, Dean found the wherewithal to talk to me at length about everything — running, writing, marriage, family, business and just everyday life.When the sun rose, I felt like I knew the real Dean.Over the course of that 24 hour race, I saw Dean sail and I saw him struggle. I observed how he handled incredible duress and extraordinary suffering in 130 F temperatures unfit for humans. I witnessed how patience and experience and faith and sheer determination got him through the countless tough spots, the dark abyss and ultimately across the Badwater finish line for the 10th time. And not for nothing, in the days before and after the race I took note of how he navigates his fame and popularity with gentlemanly presence, grace and gratitude.(Me pacing Dean at Badwater, the legendary David Goggins in the background)I consider this man to be one of the great champions of our time. A true role model. An inspiration to me personally and to millions worldwide. And someone I am lucky to call both a mentor and a friend.So what makes Dean Karnazes the most successful ultra-distance runner on Earth? Now in his 50’s, how has Dean’s perspective on nutrition evolved? After accomplishing so much, what continues to drive him? How is he able to run such great distances seemingly without fatigue?

November 23, 2014

Prepare thyself, because ready or not, the holiday season is indeed upon us.For most, this is that special time of year when — whether by conscious choice or simply due to external circumstance — we find ourselves overeating, overspending and simply overindulging in anything and everything, all in the name of celebratory merriment. When we’re not charging it on the card or spread paper thin desperately trying to fulfill all the heightened expectations this time of year presents, we find ourselves weathering an unnatural battery of social engagements and the emotionally hyper-charged land mines presented by extended family get togethers.The result?  A massive and unnatural outpouring of energy that leaves us not just out of balance, but utterly depleted — spit out the other side physically and emotionally exhausted to the core, all too often overweight and riddled with unnecessary debt.Then what? We awake on New Year’s Day committed to do and be better next time — the annual renewal ritual that inevitably falls short. A slow burn leading up to next November to repeat the cycle.The standard American approach to the holidays is unhealthy, out of balance, verging on lunacy.Let’s have a different experience. Let’s relax. Let’s make sure we’re exercising self-care. Let’s focus on the giving part. And let’s not over extend ourselves financially, emotionally or physically so we can emerge in January not just intact but truly enriched — optimistic, feeling great and energized for all the challenges and adventures presented with the birth of a new year.As we did last November ( RRP 60 ), this week Julie and I once again sit down to hash out all things holiday season with a focus on providing helpful, experience-based strategies to assist in managing the financial pitfalls, dietary challenges, precarious social environments and heightened emotional states presented by this unique time of year. In my experience, these are issues common to us all. And yet issues we go to great lengths to avoid dealing with internally, let alone discussing outwardly — typically out of fear, shame or simply a profound need to keep up appearances — all of which ultimately leaves us feeling alone and isolated in what for many can become a state of true emotional crisis. In truth, the exact opposite of what the holidays should be all about.So rather than deny or repress, let’s talk about it. Let’s get it all out in the open. And let’s work on a strategy for a better, more positive and uplifting experience. On today’s agenda:Many of the topics raised and discussed in this conversation are beautifully and concretely laid out in this very helpful companion piece by Julie entitled “How To Maintain Emotional & Financial Sanity During the Holidays”– well worth checking out.It’s about self-care people. You simply cannot expect to be able to show up, be your best self and be there for others if you are not first taking care of yourself. This is not selfish — it’s truth. And a crucial huge component of this success equation begins and ends with meditation. To learn more about Julie’s guided program discussed during the episode, click here.In addition, we also have a few delicious plant-based recipes up on the site – healthy alternatives to the the expected standard fare. Try ’em out, bring one or more to your next gathering and enjoy!This Week’s Assignment: If your past experiences with the holidays have left you emotionally, physically and or financially depleted, approach this holiday season with a firm belief that you can have a better experience. Place emphasis on self-care first. Make it a top priority to do what you need to each morning to create balance for the remainder of the day — good food, meditation, exercise. Simple, right? In theory yes. But in practice it can be tricky with all the pressures the holidays bring. So put it first, and watch your experience improve — for you and everyone you care for.Weekly Q&A: Finally, I am considering adding a second show each week (or maybe every other week) in which I engage you — the audience — more directly by answering the specific questions you want answered. So I’m going to run an experiment (a “beta test” for you techies). Send me your thoughts and questions and issues and topics — the things you would like me to address on the show — to findingultra@gmail.com. I will sift through the queries, pull out a handful and put together an episode in which I address, discuss and answer what you want to hear me talk about. Deal? Deal.I sincerely hope you enjoy this week’s offering.

November 16, 2014

I’m obsessed with the idea that we can all do and be better. That’s what this show is about — a loud and clear call to action. A graceful nudge to help anyone and everyone not just understand, but actually believe that we are all capable of so much more than we often allow ourselves to accept.Enter  David Clark.It’s fun to interview the celebrated. But quite honestly there is just something far more personally gratifying about sharing the story of an anonymous, everyman hero. What truly moves and inspires me are tales of regular people with regular problems who courageously meet severe challenges head on; do something unexpected and astounding that strains the boundaries of what we imagine possible; and come out the other side transformed with life lessons that can benefit us all.Much like my conversation with Josh LaJaunie ( RRP #63 is a must listen if you haven’t already and in my top-5 most downloaded shows), this interview will move you. It will touch you. It will erase whatever obstacles and excuses you rely on that perpetuate bad habits, keep you stuck and reinforce denial. My sincere hope is that David’s story will help you really get that no matter what your circumstances or environment, that you always hold the power to implement personal change that can profoundly alter the trajectory of your life — beyond your wildest imagination even.I was first introduced to David by my friend Mishka Shubaly ( another RRP fave with a shocking 5 appearances on the show ). I didn’t know anything about him, but when Mishka says he’s worth investigating, I investigate.I winced at photos of a guy pushing 320 pounds, prematurely aged, red-faced and bloated, cocktail in hand. I know an alcoholic when I see one, and this image of David cut a little too close to home. A guy who looked like hell, red lining towards death without a care while wrecking havoc, destruction and woe in the lives of loved ones and anyone and who happened to cross his path.Then I saw a picture of a fit and slim 165 pound athlete crossing the finish line at insane ultra-marathons like the Leadville 100 and  Badwater – a 135 mile run across Death Valley in 130-degree July heat — widely considered to be the world’s two toughest footraces.The 320+ pound guy, who looked like some kind of menacing Archie Bunker-esque uncle you’re scared to talk to bore almost no resemblance to that runner achieving things that would impress even the most accomplished marathoners. To say that I was amazed by the astounding extent to which he had seemingly transformed his life would be an understatement. My first thought was, can this be real?But when I looked closely, it was undeniable. It was indeed the same guy.I needed to know more. I needed to know how he did it. So I reached out to David and he sent me his self-published memoir,  Out There: A Story of Ultra Recovery*. After reading the first page, I knew I had to have him on the show.David’s is the story of a man who never had a chance to find out who he was. Growing up in the hardest of circumstances, poor, homeless, without any formal education and traveling the country in his father’s pickup truck, he’s a kid who grew up no stranger to the hard knocks of life. This book is a no-holds barred, at times quite painful personal account of what it’s really like to be obese. What it really feels like to be an alcoholic in the firm grips of disease without hope of escape. Spiraling toward death, spending years eating recklessly, drinking and drugging himself, David grew farther and farther away from everyone around him until he found himself completely alone. Desperate. Broken. In a fleeting moment of clarity, a thought occurred to him:“If I don’t change today, I will die.”Ultimately Dave had enough. Pulling from deep reserves, he somehow found the wherewithal to finally face and overcome his demons, transform his life wholesale and ultimately accomplish feats most sane people would deem impossible. First he recovered from a death-sentence addiction to drugs and alcohol that destroyed his career, his family and nearly his life. Then he overcame a life-long addiction to unhealthy foods & lifestyle habits to discover a healthy (now plant-based) way of living. Hand in hand with his life overhaul came a deep passion for running.When he began, David could only run 15 seconds before having to stop, out of breath. But he persisted. And the results are staggering. He didn’t just drop 150 pounds. He didn’t just complete a half-marathon. He didn’t just complete a marathon. And he didn’t just finish the Badwater 135, but a whole slew of impressive ultra-marathons, including a stab at the 12-hour treadmill run world record. Today, David is a loving father of three, a running coach, sponsored runner, speaker, and a gym owner. And the running odyssey continues. Just today he texted me to let me in on a new challenge – he intends to run the Boston Marathon 4-times in a row to honor the memory of a young girl that passed away this year!Not enough? David dedicates his remaining free time to The Superman Project, a vehicle he created to help others and further share his story of how we can all change everything about ourselves if we want it badly enough.This week I am beyond pleased to give Dave a well-deserved microphone to serve this powerful message. So just how did he do it?

November 9, 2014

You could say this show has been on a bit of a plant-based tear lately, and this week it continues with with my friend Bryant Terry – eco-chef, cookbook author, educator and most interesting to me, a renown social justice activist focused on promoting and healthy, just, affordable and sustainable food systems for all people – particularly the underprivileged living in underserved urban communities. His goal? To foster awareness, promote change and create opportunities for people living in urban food deserts — places where fresh, healthy, sustainable food is difficult or impossible to obtain.Why? Because good food should be an everyday right — not a privilege.Bryant’s got a slew of really beautiful cookbooks that fuse his Memphis family roots and the traditions of true southern African American cooking with art, music, literature a modern plant-based perspective. His most recent offering,  Afro Vegan* was named one of the “Best Cookbooks of 2014″  by Amazon.com and his critically acclaimed Vegan Soul Kitchen* was named one of the best vegetarian/vegan cookbooks of the last 25 years by Cooking Light Magazine.Bryant’s work has been featured in The New York Times, Food and Wine, Gourmet, Sunset, Oprah Magazine and Essence and he has appeared on The Martha Stewart Show, Emeril, All Things COnsidered, Morning Edition, The Splendid Table, and The Tavis Smiley Show. In addition, Bryant has deleivered keynote addresses at countless events and on college campuses including Brown, Columbia, NYU, Smith, Stanford and Yale.In addition, TheRoot.com  included him on its list of “100 most influential African Americans,” and Ebony magazine listed him on its annual “Power 100” list.Still not impressed? On top of everything else, Bryant is also the 2014  Artist in Residence at San Francisco’s Grace Cathedral, where he is curating interesting gatherings with an eye towards promoting deeper community roots.I could go on – Bryant’s accolades are many – but you get the idea. This guy is so much more than a chef and cookbook author. Behind the affable disposition and congenial smile, Bryant is a true progressive; a boundary pushing, paradigm breaking community-minded advocate passionately devoted to promoting better access to healthful, affordable foods for urban African American and minority communities and tackling the industrialized food system that has made it far too easy for these economically challenged communities to shirk healthy habits in favor of cheap meat and the convenience of fast food.Bryant delivers the goods on multiple levels and this is an awesome conversation. A dialog that starts with food as the common thread that unites us all and veers into food politics, the economic aspects of food choice, food as a platform to create better communities and food as a vehicle for social justice.I sincerely hope this week’s offering.

November 2, 2014

Confession time.I’m the first to admit that my initial reasons for adopting a plant-based lifestyle were selfish. I was overweight. I felt lousy. I looked lousy. I had a health scare. Basically, I just wanted to look and feel better. I wanted to enjoy my kids at their energy level. I wasn’t ready to succumb to middle age defeat.So I took the leap. A leap without much expectation I might add.Then the miracle. I dropped 50 pounds. My vitality returned. That long-gone youthful glow restored. I didn’t just get my life back, I got an entirely new one. Today I am living the life beyond my wildest dreams.I could have never predicted the journey that would follow this simple decision. It has been long, at times hard, but ultimately extraordinary in every way imaginable. It’s not an understatement that everything in my life has changed for the better. And for that I am extremely grateful.There is one thing I know with certainty. If you want a great life, give more than you receive. This is primary reason behind my decision to start this podcast — to share with you the people, information, tools and inspiration that have been so incredibly transformative in my life.But let’s be honest. I didn’t get into this plant-based lifestyle because I wanted to save the animals. Frankly, my concern for the health of the planet could be characterized as passive lip service at best. I was the furthest thing from a food activist. And when it came to environmental, ethical and political issues like GMO’s, the deleterious effects of factory farming, slaughterhouse conditions, carbon emissions, the deforestation of the rainforests, species extinction, the mistreatment of circus animals, the pollution and overfishing of our oceans and the moral implications of harvesting animals for food, the truth is that I didn’t really give it much thought.That was then. But this is now.In the eight years since I began this journey, I have changed. I have grown. Ever so slowly, my eyes have started to open to a myriad of uncomfortable realities relating to how our world functions. Unpleasant and unnecessary realities that I can no longer in good conscience turn a blind eye to.I’ve been blessed with a platform. My book and this podcast have given me an audience. With this comes a certain responsibility that I take seriously.What is that responsibility? I can’t say that I’m entirely sure. However, I do know that it entails a commitment to the truth. A commitment to shed light on and help raise awareness around issues that affect not just me, but all of us. Things that are not right. Things that need to change.The truth isn’t always comfortable. It’s generally not convenient. And often not popular because it challenges us to think differently and in many cases modify behaviors we might not want to modify.To me, the truth also presents a growth opportunity. An opportunity to be bold. To do and be better. I know can do better. And if this podcast isn’t about that, then it’s just wasted air.Our fast-paced, hyper-industrialized world lives in a comfortable haze of convenience priority. We go about our day happily and for the most part unconsciously disconnected from the process undertaken to bring consumer products into our homes. This includes the clothes we wear, the devices we use and of course the foods we enjoy.This is process I really don’t want to look at. It’s uncomfortable because it forces me to transcend denial and truly consider what actually goes on behind the shroud of obfuscation erected by giant conglomerates, powerful lobbying efforts and governmental forces that have a strong vested interest in maintaining the disconnect that cloaks the public from certain unpalatable realities.Dismantling the disconnect isn’t fun. Certainly not as fun as riding my bike. Given a choice, and in my earlier incarnation, I’d be the first to look the other way and go happily about my day, irked by anyone presumptive enough to challenge my chimera of comfortable ideals.But I can’t live that way anymore. Because delusion, ignorance and consumer malaise have become more uncomfortable to me than the truth. In recovery, they say “the road gets narrower.” I didn’t used to know what that means.Now I do. This is what this week’s show is all about.A veteran of the animal rights movement, and this week’s guest, Lisa Lange is Executive Vice President of PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). She has coordinated the production of some of PETA’s most popular and successful videos and PSAs and works closely with celebrity PETA supporters, including Alec Baldwin, Bill Maher, Charlize Theron, Eva Mendes, and Casey Affleck. She also networks with Hollywood directors, producers, and writers, convincing them to incorporate positive animal messages into TV programs and movies.A gifted debater, Lisa is a regular guest on The O’Reilly Factor and has debated animal rights opponents on Today, CNBC, Nancy Grace, Larry King Live, Your World With Neil Cavuto, and countless other television and radio networks and programs. She has appeared many times on entertainment shows—such as Entertainment Tonight and CNN’s Showbiz Tonight—and on E! to discuss PETA’s work in Hollywood. Her efforts to save animals have made headlines in major publications throughout the country, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, and USA Today.Again, I have never been a vocal animal rights activist. And I wasn’t sure I was all that comfortable with some of the tactics undertaken by PETA to raise awareness. Why? Because they challenged me to think about issues I didn’t really want to think about. But Lisa – a friend as well as an avid and accomplished triathlete in her own right — has been instrumental in my own personal evolution, helping me grapple with, better understand and ultimately embrace the bigger issues at play.Being comfortable is lazy. Being comfortable is at odds with growth. And more often that not, being comfortable flies in the face of truth. Personal truth. And truth that affects all of us. And by all, I mean every living thing.So today I’m owning it. Shining a light on uncomfortable, inconvenient realities I feel I cannot ignore — the terrible and inexcusable plight suffered by the billions of helpless animals that are abused, tortured and mistreated as cogs in the massive wheel that is our industrialized food system. A system that is beyond untenable, utterly unsustainable, unequivocally unethical and unfathomably destructive to our environment (I know — that’s a lot of “u-words”).Intended to challenge your comfort zone, this conversation is about what we vote for when we go to the circus, buy clothes and purchase food. It’s a discussion about values. Simply put, ignorance isn’t cool. And how we spend our hard earned dollars is important. Because each dollar spent is a reflection of our values. It represents a vote for who we are and what we stand for. And that vote – as small and as insignificant and disenfranchised as you might feel it to be – actually is important. A vote we can collectively leverage to forge a better world for ourselves, our children and future generations.Even if you are someone with a negative preconception of the animal rights movement, I implore you to set aside those notions and enter into this conversation with an open mind.Because contempt prior to investigation is tantamount to willful ignorance.At our core, I truly believe we are all compassionate beings. True strength means embracing that core value. And there is something about that that is just downright cool.So let’s do something different. Let’s own it.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

October 26, 2014

This show is about chasing dreams. Making stuff happen. Helping others. And sharing the journey.We can all use a little education. Some solid information. And a dose of experience-based inspiration to guide our own path towards self-betterment. My goal is to help you see and understand that we are generally our own self-limiter. That we are all capable of being better and doing more, irrespective of circumstances. That we all have a more authentic self lying dormant within yearning to be more self-expressed.We owe it to ourselves to fertilize that seed. Why?Because life is short.Trite? yes. Cheesy? definitely. But nonetheless oh so true. Right now I’m up in Palo Alto at Stanford University for my 25th Reunion. 25 years since I graduated from college. How is that possible? Translation: I am old.Old is a mindset. Another lame idiom I choose to believe. Honestly, I feel like I am about 28. But this weekend made me acutely aware of the fleeting and transitory nature of our lives.It seems like yesterday I was in school with all these amazing people with whom I spent the last few days reconnecting and reminiscing. People that have ventured forth to do extraordinary things like found billion dollar startups; create non-profits that have helped millions; and launch movements that have forever altered how we think and live.This not hyperbole. This is Stanford — a place; an institution; and a mindset that fosters the ethos that truly anything is possible. That you should challenge authority. That you must question the status quo. It’s a culture that empowers the philosophy that not only can you change the world, but that it’s in fact your responsibility.This weekend I was surrounded by people who have done and are doing just that. I am tremendously grateful for the experience. And it left me inspired to do and be better.25 years, man. Life is short. There is no time for idleness. There is no time to equivocate.Speaking of eradicating limitations, today marks the return of my ultrarunning buddy Josh Spector – if you are a long-time listener you will recall our conversation from last year, recounting our respective experiences crewing for Dean Karnazes and Ray Sanchez at the Badwater 135 ( RRP 40 ).Widely accepted as the “World’s Toughest Foot Race”,  Badwater  is a 135 mile running race across Death Valley — the hottest place on Earth — where temperatures average 120+ in July and can reach as high as 130 with pavements temps typically in the 170-180 degree range. Starting at Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below sea level, approximately 100 invitation-only runners from across the globe begin a jaunt that takes them across bleak and scorching desert terrain as well as three formidable mountain passes, including the culminating 13-mile ascent up the portals of Mt. Whitney — the highest peak in the lower 48 — to finish at 8,300 feet.This past summer, and for the first time, Josh stepped up his game and ran the legendary — but recently revised — race himself.This week’s show is a rare peek behind the curtain at exactly what it takes to prepare for, endure and complete one of the most difficult running challenges on the planet – a race that requires and demonstrates a most incredible display of the indomitable nature of the human spirit.Josh is a great guy. A humble guy. Sharing his experience is powerful because he isn’t Dean Karnazes. He isn’t a professional athlete. Josh is just a normal dude who had a dream. A regular guy who fell in love with running. Put the work in brick by brick and day by day. Bided his time. Toiled patiently and relentlessly in obscurity. Invested in the journey. And experienced what it’s like when all the hard work pays off, culminating in an extraordinary accomplishment. An accomplishment I’m sure just a few years ago he would have imagined was not just beyond his reach, but impossible.When this interview concludes, I promise you be inspired to raise the ceiling on your own personal capabilities.I hope you enjoy the conversation.

October 19, 2014

I say it all the time. Change is not an overnight miracle, people. I know there’s nothing like the neatly packaged narrative of the overnight success story, but honestly that’s just well, not that honest.The truth is that long-lasting, sustainable personal growth is never instantaneous. It’s messy. Non-linear. Two steps backwards for every step in the right direction. It’s forged out of self-experimentation, research, discomfort, failure, courage, and all too often a lot of stumbling around in the dark.The point? It’s not a clean line. We don’t have to hold on to this perfectionist ideal. In fact, it’s this ideal that generally hold us back. Paralyzes us. Or leads to self-defeatism when we fall short of idealized goals.When I began the process of repairing my health, I made a million mistakes. Slipped up countless times. And when I committed to getting fit, Ultraman didn’t even qualify as a fantasy because I had never heard of it. I just wanted to be able to run a mile. Goals and success came later. I was able to get off the dime because I just started. Implicit in this was the permission I gave myself to fail.Let go of perfection. Whether the change you seek is related to diet, fitness, career, finances, education or some specific skill set, the important thing is to allow yourself to just begin, and begin messy. You don’t have to know where anything is leading. You don’t have to change evertything overnight. And the steps you take don’t have to be plotted, overthought or even pretty. But you do have to start.Or as today’s guest suggests, Lean In…My friend Kathy Freston is a 4-time New York Times bestselling author of  The Lean, Veganist, Quantum Wellness  and  Quantum Wellness Cleanse. She has appeared frequently on national television, including The Oprah Winfrey Show, Ellen, The Dr. Oz Show, The View, Good Morning America, Charlie Rose, The Martha Stewart Show, and Extra. Her work has been featured notably in Vanity Fair, Harper’s Bazaar, Self, W, and Fitness. In addition, she is a regular contributor to her pal Ariana Huffington’s publication, Huffington Post.Back in 2011, it was Kathy’s appearance on Oprah that inspired the great Ms. Winfrey herself – and her entire staff of 378 — to go entirely vegan for 21 days.In January 2014, Kathy famously launched a  Change.org  petition campaign urging McDonald’s to debut a vegetarian menu item, a petition that went viral with over 106,000 supporters and very well may lead to the desired outcome. This is a great example of Kathy’s approach of working with the system to catalyze change and disrupt status quo paradigms.I met the delightful and beautiful Ms. Freston several years ago and always wanted to have her on the show. What I like about her is her very easy going, accessible approach to helping people make long-lasting sustainable shifts in their diet and lifestyle – everything about her style is very inviting, grounded and understanding of the stressors and limiters that envelop living a modern busy life. Hence her coined term, and the title of her most recent book,  The Lean. Another way of saying progress, not perfection.Today we sit down and hash out her personal journey, what led her to becoming one of the most visible, prominent and persuasive voices in the plant-based movement, and effective strategies we can all leverage to develop a healthier, happier, more plantpowered approach to diet and life.I sincerely hope you enjoy this lean into the world of Kathy Freston.

October 12, 2014

Life throws all of us obstacles. Everyone meets barriers. Nobody is immune from setbacks. It’s how we confront and navigate past the curve balls life throws that moulds character and ultimately defines who we really are.Do you crumble or rise to the challenge? Do you shrink down and become the victim? Or do you stand tall and walk through adversity like a warrior?And what do you do if everything just goes to shit?You are hard pressed to find a man who has met so much adversity with such a grounded sense of purpose and honest willingness to share about it as Mark Miller.Meet Fightshark. Just make sure you check your grousing at the door.Born with both Type-1 Diabetes and a congenital heart defect (CHD), Mark was reared by the back hand of an alcoholic abusive father. A World War II vet and notable professional athlete who played in the very fist NBA game ever, “Moose” Miller was a domineering force of nature who experienced the world as a dark, unfair and often violent place – and made sure he prepared his son accordingly.To escape the emotional and physical violence that greeted him at home, Mark immersed himself in the world of sports at a very young age. Thrown into a boxing gym at age 6, he quickly adapted, eventually mastering every sport imaginable by the time he finished high school. During his free time he worked in the Pittsburgh Steelers locker room (from age six through high school), grabbing towels, taking grief and learning about sport and life from the hand of legends like Lynn Swann, Mel Blount, Jack Ham and Mean Joe Greene while also working on his pitching with guys like Barry Bonds. All champions that in some sense served surrogate dad duty for this evolving teen.By the time he was 18, Mark was poised to go professional as a major league pitcher. But Mark had other plans – he wanted to become a professional kickboxer.By 2007, Mark was a rising star in this emerging sport  until a routine physical uncovered a serious cardiac condition that required open-heart surgery to replace his aortic valve.The crisis helped to temporarily reunite his fractured family. But everybody thought Mark’s fighting days were over. Once again, Mark had other plans — the surgery just made him more determined than ever to return to the kickboxing ring. Astounded by the rapid rate at which Mark’s heart healed, his doctors gave him the green light to resume training. Everything in Mark’s life seemed to be getting back on track.But 2008 had little respect for Mark’s plans.Over the course of that year, Mark lost both his parents and his drug addict brother to an overdose. A confluence of events that led Mark to lose himself in drugs and alcohol, culminating in a boozy accident that hurled his already fractured and fragile body through a car windshield and onto hard unforgiving Austin, Texas pavement.Eventually, Mark found the wherewithal to get and stay sober. Renewed, he set his sights once again on his kickboxing comeback. Despite being labeled damaged goods, in 2011 Mark returned to the ring in Moscow and shocked the fight world when he took out one of the world’s best with a knockout in just 8 seconds.To this day, Fightshark is the first and only combat sport athlete to return to competition after undergoing open heart surgery.Fast forward to 2013. Just prior to his fight debut in storied Madison Square Garden, Mark contracted pneumonia, which set in motion a devastating domino effect of health cataclysms that have left him with chronic kidney failure, blindness in one eye, and the need for not one but three organ transplants: heart, pancreas and kidney.Mark is currently fighting for his life. Literally.In unapologetic fashion, Mark chronicles the insanity of his life and adventures in his truly compelling, raw, at times sad and yet completely engrossing new book  Pain Don’t Hurt*. It’s a story of incredible tenacity, dedication, and hard work. It’s a sincere and earnest tale of family, fatherhood, and the hard lessons about masculinity and violence learned from his father. And it’s a deeply personal tribute to the never-say-die spirit embodied in a man who refuses to back down, no matter the odds.Even if you don’t care at all for kickboxing, the UFC or anything having to do with MMA, you will be hard pressed not to be riveted by Mark’s astounding tale of superhuman resiliency and what it truly takes to meet and weather adversity on the grandest scale.It was an honor to sit down with Mark, a man poised to inspire millions. So quit your whining and let’s step into the ring for a few rounds with the one and only Fightshark.I hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

October 5, 2014

If you are a consistent listener to this show, then you know very well that my goal is to elucidate the experience, insights and knowledge of my guests as a tool to aid you on your progress towards greater self-actualization.Food is a super important aspect of this process. I believe it’s the best place to begin the process of transforming your life. But it’s also easy to get overly caught up in the dogmatic aspects of diet and nutrition. Unnecessarily boxed in by labels. Overly focused on details and minutiae. This presents a treacherous social, political and internal minefield that can result in truncating long-term growth potential. Because when we obsess on our plate at the exclusion of objectively redressing the many other very important areas of our lives that warrant focus and attention, our overall development towards full actualization is arrested.I didn’t clean up my diet so I could get stuck pontificating on the various types of dark leafy greens until all my friends fled for the hills. I cleaned up my diet so I could raise my energy levels, shift my consciousness and direct my newfound lease on life towards continual growth and expansion. A search for greater meaning, purpose and answers that will hopefully occupy me for the remainder of my days here on Earth.Optimal nutrition based on plant-based foods is a great step in the direction of optimal wellness.. But that is all that it is — a step. Hardly the be-all-end-all. Because wellness encompasses so much more than food. Far from the end of inquiry, think of quality nutrition more as a right of initiation that will repair your physical body, raise your vibration, elevate your consciousness and take you on a wild and unexpected journey towards healing, a sense of purpose, greater authenticity and actualization that will be unpredictable and challenging but ultimately astounding.This is a process Julie and I call going beyond the kale. And it’s the primary theme of this week’s offering.Enter Tim Van Orden.If you have been with me on this podcast journey since it’s inception, then you will recall my conversation with Tim back in the early days – RRP Episode 15 to be exact. Over the course of that conversation we delved into Tim’s personal story, particularly his trajectory from relatively aimless and unhealthy junk food vegetarian to the raw food fueled running champion he is today. An exploration of food, athleticism, consciousness and holistic minimalism that transformed this non-athlete into a 10-time US Masters Trail Running National Champion.You may also recall the horrible Skype audio. At that time I was still trying to find my voice and had yet to master the technology (I still haven’t, which is one of many reasons why I resist interviewing guests by Skype). Moreover, I had yet to actually meet Tim in person. Fast forward 92 episodes and now we’re friends — conversing in person and picking up where Episode 15 left off.This week it’s less about diet and more about the bigger picture. Specifically, this conversation focuses on the psychology and emotional landscape that informs and drives self-perception, habits (both healthy and unhealthy) and decision making. This is a very frank, honest, open and soul bearing exchange about ego, vulnerability, authenticity, and attachment. It’s about self-image as a predictor of mood, action and outcome. It’s about the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves that inform how we see ourselves in the world. It’s about the self-acceptance required to confront and ultimately overcome the dreaded and unhealthy aspects of ourselves we keep hidden that handicap growth. And it’s about the process we must undertake to reframe our story, start telling a new one and ultimately set us on a healthier path towards greater freedom and fulfillment.I really dig Tim, his vibe, honesty and willingness to be raw (pardon the pun). He is truly a special guy and I am so pleased to bring his insights to you today. I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam. Just awesome.P.S. At the beginning of the show, I fumbled my thoughts when trying to describe my take on the nutritional benefits of the miracle superfood called Moringa (Olefiera), so I thought I would expound upon it here. Dubbed the “miracle tree” and the “world’s most nutritious plant species ever studied,” this amazing tree is native to regions of Africa/Asia but can grow almost anywhere due to its incredible ability to extract nutrients from the soil and air. Its leaves are an all-around green superfood; with more than 90 nutrients, moringa is like a utility baseball player that can excel in every position. High in a wide array of vitamins and minerals it’s anti-oxidant rich (46 anti-oxidants), anti-diabetes (reduces blood glucose) and promotes heart health (lipid lowering) among other benefits. Available in capsule and powder form, brew the powder into a tea or add to juice or your morning smoothie (like the smoothie Tim and I shared over our conversation).SHOW NOTESConnect with Tim & Running Raw: Website | YouTube | Facebook | TwitterHow to Make an Ironman Whimper (and Cough): NY Times Sunday MagazineThe Tim Van Orden Book Club: A compendium of unlikely but highly recommended books & audiobooks germane to this week’s conversation:*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

September 28, 2014

The subject of “Millennials” generally conjures up adjectives like lazy or entitled. No work ethic. Spoiled brats, the lot of them. TIME Magazine went so far as to call millennials the “Me Me Me Generation”.This has not been my experience with the teens and twenty-somethings among us. In fact, I can honestly say that I find myself relating to many millennials better than I relate to my own generation. Maybe that just makes me juvenile. But that’s a perspective lazier that the millennial stereotype itself.Admittedly, my exposure to this cross-section of our society is somewhat self-selecting. But it’s worth noting that over the last several years I’ve had the good fortune of meeting dozens of incredibly dynamic, conscious and entrepreneurial young people. Kids highly engaged in things my generation didn’t give a crap about like permaculture, social issues, sustainability, conservation and mindfulness. Students with doctorates and business degrees who could be on Wall Street instead toiling away on organic farms, working for non-profits, or starting their own — choosing career paths based not on security and salary but on impact. People leveraging the power of social media to challenge societal norms, disrupt outdated modalities, create self-styled careers that didn’t previously exist and launch their own grassroots movements.The common thread is the singular goal — to make the world a better place for all of us.Jackson Foster is one of these guys — the best kind of millennial. A guy whose life presented him with every open door possible, it would have been easy for Jackson to simply step into a safe and secure (an illusion I know, but you get my point) high paying business career.But Jackson has other plans.In high school, while most of Jackson’s teen peers were playing video games, partying and generally just acting like, well teenagers, Jackson spent a year in the Colorado wilderness. After being accepted into the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design, he decided instead to defer so he could travel – a year spent bicycling across the US, hiking the John Muir Trail, mountaineering in Laos and even working at an orangutan orphanage in Borneo.These experiences left him thinking about one thing: food.Jackson noticed how food greatly affected the livelihood of different communities around the world, which motivated a desire to immerse himself in diet and lifestyle study. This exploration left him with no choice but to walk his talk; a wholesale transition from a beer drinking, weed smoking, junk food vegetarian teenager reborn as a whole food plant-based activist and educator.Jackson transferred from RISD to Colorado College as an Environmental Policy major and went to work. Outside his college coursework he found the time to: become a Certified Yoga Instructor; obtain a  Certification In Plant-based Nutrition through the T. Colin Campbell Center for Nutrition Studies ; start the website Plantriotic ; found and chair a vegan student group at Colorado College; write for Vegan Health and Fitness Magazine ; spend his summers working with environmental groups like 350.org ; help with student recruitment for the recent People’s Climate March in New York City; and last but hardly least, begin work on his first book.How’s that for a lazy, entitled millennial?I first met this week’s enterprising young guest last Spring when he invited me to speak at Colorado College. It was a fantastic experience, which included quality time spent with him, his fellow students as well as his documentary filmmaker brother and lovely and incredibly supportive parents, all three of whom flew out from Los Angeles just to support Jackson in hosting my presentation.In stark contrast to my self-obsessed, party-dominated college experience, I was struck by Jackson’s passion as well as inspired by his personal story. An evolution from typical high school student to independent thinker with an unequivocal dedication to fostering a healthier, more ethical and sustainable approach to individual and planetary wellness.Even if you happen to disagree with aspects of his point of view (Jackson is nothing if not a bit radical, admittedly so) you will be hard pressed not to be impressed by his conviction; his selfless devotion to service; and the courageous choices this young man has made for the simple sake of making the world just a little bit better.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

September 21, 2014

Some people are artists. Others are athletes. It’s the rare individual who can excel at both.As I kid, I was interested in sport and things creative. But for some reason, I came to the conclusion that you just can’t do it all. I had to pick and never the ‘twain shall meet. Call it a left brain, right brain thing.Most of us lean in one direction. We’re either logical and calculated by nature, or we’re whimsical dreamers. We settle on a side and call it a day. But what if we really could excel at both?My Australian mate Daniel MacPherson is great example of someone who seamlessly traverses back and forth between seemingly unrelated worlds, tightrope walking both hemispheres of the mysterious cranium with facile grace and ease. Not only is he a tremendously talented and gifted athlete – a guy who has competed at the highest levels in triathlon, he is also a quite gifted artist – as an actor, television host and media personality. Not to mention an exceptionally successful and celebrated one at that.It’s by no means a stretch to call Dan the Ryan Secrest of Australia — and I mean that in the most complimentary, non-perjorative sense. Brimming with good looks, endless charm, intelligence, athletic prowess and creativity to boot, quite simply put it’s hard to imagine there is anything Dan can’t do, and do well.Dan has qualified for and raced the Ironman World Championships, the Half Ironman 70.3 World Championships, and began his triathlon career at the storied Cronulla Triathlon Club in the suburbs of Sydney, training amidst the sport’s greatest athletes – world champions like Craig Alexander & Chris McCormack  (my guest on RRP episode 24 ). This is the same club that produced triathlon legends Greg Welch and Michellie Jones – the biggest names in the more formative years of triathlon.As a youth, Dan was intent on becoming the best triathlete he could be. Then something totally out of the blue happened. At the conclusion of a local race, he was “discovered.”The rest is history.Best known for his role on Australia’s long running series Neighbours, Dan starred in  City Homicide , the British police drama  The Bill  and was the host of Australia’s  X-Factor. He is the currently co-host of Australia’s wildly popular  Dancing with the Stars  and is starring in a soon to be released independent sci-fi drama called Infini  (trailer below).But despite Dan’s blinding good looks and impeccable fitness, what is amazing is that it wasn’t always this way. You might be surprised to learn that Dan was actually a chubby and somewhat insecure young bloke. A kid who, at a young age, embraced fitness and healthy lifestyle to transcend his situation and transform himself wholesale.Passionate about service and giving back, Dan now leverages his fame and popularity for the benefit of the Indigenous Marathon Project, a non-profit dedicated to uplifting Australia’s Indigenous populations via the transformative power of marathon running. An organization devoted to creating Indigenous role models, inspiring Indigenous people and promoting healthy and active lifestyles throughout Indigenous communities across Australia.He may not be a full blown professional triathlete, but Dan is beyond pro behind the microphone. Because he is so highly engaging, Dan makes my job easy and this is a really fun conversation. A conversation that traverses triathlon, television, movies, the LA entertainment business, creativity, the quest for athletic prowess and how he successfully balances all of the important aspects of his life to stay on top.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

September 14, 2014

Safe to say I am mildly obsessed with Ganesh, the famous Hindu elephant boy god.Even if you don’t know anything about this odd creature or what he represents, you likely know who I’m talking about. The iconic youngster’s unmistakeable visage is ubiquitous these days — adorning yoga studios, hanging around people’s homes, emblazoned on t-shirts and even splayed across brick wall street art in hipster neighborhoods across America.But how does this have anything to do with this week’s guest?Patience. I’ll bring it around. I always do.The thumbnail fable of Ganesh goes something like this: young boy warrior fiercely devoted to his beloved mother Parvati meets his match in Parvati’s abusive husband Shiva. Defending Parvati from Shiva’s angry rage late one night while Parvati bathed, Shiva up and just decapitates the young boy. Cut his head straight off!Inconsolable and furious, Parvati is determined to bring her boy back to life. Towards this end, she strikes a deal with Shiva that (inexplicably) involves replacing Ganesh’s missing head with that of a young elephant (again, don’t ask me how this works, it just does). Rejoice! It works. Not only does Ganesh return to life, he ascends the covetous deity pecking order, becoming one of the most worshipped of ancient Hindu devas.Ganesh the remover of obstacles. Ganesh the patron of arts. Ganesh the deity of intellect and wisdom. Ganesh the Lord of success.The elephant head represents the displacement of individual ego with Universal ego – the idea that before we leave this life we must no longer identify with the limited individual self, but rather with the large universal Self. In this way, our spiritual life is renewed, maturing into one that can truly benefit Creation.Associated with mental agility, Ganesh’s single broken tusk represents the “pen” he creates to transcribe epic poetry — the vast learnings he has experienced. What I’m saying is that Ganesh was a writer.Ganesh was also a god of astounding appetites. And – most importantly for today’s discourse — a god that befriended a tiny mouse, often depicted under his foot as his ever present companion. The mouse is commonly interpreted as a symbol for those seeking to overcome powerful low vibrating desires and become less selfish — the quest to find greater meaning and purpose in life.Here’s where things get weird. The life arc of todays guest  Mishka Shubaly  (in his fifth appearance on the podcast – more co-host than guest at this point) bears more than passing similarity to our little Hindu friend.Sorry Mishka, but I would go so far as to call you guys doppelgängers. Metaphorically at least.Like Ganesh, Mishka is a man devoted to the arts and greater self-wisdom. A man devoted to his mother and scarred by a troubled relationship with his father. A man who has made his mark on the world by transcribing his broken past and attraction to destructive appetites as a primer for greater self-knowledge with a fearlessness that evokes Ganesh’s broken tusk. A man now ascending to become foremost among literary talents.Mishka’s words serve up someone toiling with identity, his place in the world, and the conflict that breathes between ego and Universal Self. A man grappling with his own obstacles on a path towards maturing into one who can truly benefit Creation. An appealing yet reluctant determination for greater self-wisdom I think we can all — on some level — relate to our own personal challenges and life experiences.And yet quite ironically, Mishka is also man who just just weeks ago knew little to nothing about this Ganesh character. This despite the huge elephant tattoo covering the better part of his left arm. The elephant t-shirts that bear his name. And his pet mouse.You heard me right.Mishkalito the tiny mouse that just as Ganesh, Mishka befriended that became his constant companion. A mouse that broke his heart wide open. A symbol for his gut wrenching wrangling laid bare. And a mouse that became the central subject in this writer’s latest confessional — the #1 bestselling Kindle Single  Of Mice and Me*. A novella that pits Mishka’s low vibrating desires against his persistent, yet almost diffident yearning for greater meaning, connection and purpose.Mishka, the modern day Ganesh. I like the ring of that.Told you I’d bring it around. I always do.If you are a long-time listener of the podcast, then you’ve treated yourself to several of our conversations. You know this guy at this point. He doesn’t need much formal introduction.If you care about things like resumés, his goes something like this:After receiving an expensive MFA from Columbia University, Mishka promptly quit writing to play music. He lived out of a Toyota minivan for a year, touring nonstop, and has shared the stage with artists like The Strokes, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs and The Decemberists.His Kindle Singles – short non fiction novellas — have all been bestsellers. He writes true stories about drinking, drugs, disasters, desire, deception and their aftermath. His work has been praised for its grit, humor, fearlessness and heart.  The Long Run*, his mini-memoir detailing his transformation from alcoholic drug abuser to sober ultra-runner is one of the best-selling Kindle Singles in Amazon history.I urge all of you to check out his canon (links below). And no, you do not need a Kindle! You can read these offerings on basically any computer device; there are even free Kindle apps for both iOS and Android.If you dig the Mishka vibe and want to hear more, check out RRP episodes 27, 31,  65 & 95. That’s about 7 hours of Mishka for your earbuds.Otherwise, I hope you enjoy this peek into the complicated, curious, fascinating and always entertaining mind of Mishka Shubaly. Pretty sure this is our best conversation to date.

“No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.”Albert EinsteinWise words that capture the essence of this week’s guest, Preston Smiles.When you meet Preston, you immediately understand who this guy is. He wears it on his sleeve. It’s written all over his face. He just is exactly who he is.It’s much harder to describe Preston in words. But I’ll give it a shot. A leader in the emergent world of conscious media, Preston is a pretty unique cat — one of the most present, focused, passionate, open and giving people I have ever met. But honestly, everything that Preston is can be boiled down to one word – maybe the most important word in our lexicon – love.A wellspring of creativity, Preston is a writer (Huff Po / The Daily Love), a motivational messenger, a thought leader and co-founder of something called  The Love Mob  – a global, grassroots flash mob movement that ignites community building through “Organized Acts of Love.”The Preston I know is an unlikely evolution from a very different guy. Raised under challenging circumstances, young Preston was a hyperactive, dyslexic gang member prone to beatings and beating others. An angry, disenfranchised young man looking at an almost certain future of violence, drug abuse, jails and institutions.But Preston was able to escape this path. An emotional and spiritual transformation that instead produced a man full of life, devoted to serving others and downright unafraid to embrace and exude love, consciousness and unity — hardly the most popular subjects among men in our society.Preston is both a friend and an inspiration, and I am proud to share his powerful story and message with you today.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

Do that, repeat it until it becomes the new default thought replacing the old negative one.

August 31, 2014

In case you missed it, and because it’s highly relevant to today’s show, let’s begin this week’s offering with a read (or re-read?) of a piece I posted a while back on  Medium.com  entitled,  Why You Should Stop Hacking Your Life & Invest in The Journey.Before you pounce on me for going all Grandpa Roll on you, let me point out that I’m all for efficiencies. But I’m more about the 10,000 hours of hard work that goes into creating something amazing. The hustle, passion, focus, and grit required to birth a dream. The work ethic and commitment to not just be good, but great – not just for you – driven by ego or self-aggrandizement – but for the betterment of everyone.Whether you get there or not, it’s the commitment I admire. It’s the action that matters. So stop resisting it by obsessing on shortcuts and instead just embrace the work. Because the inherent value in any undertaking is the road travelled to get there anyway. Do this, and you will be amazed by the places your life will take you.Today’s guest embodies this ethos perfectly.I love Amanda Slavin because she gets it. Someone who had a crazy vision, set aside her fear, took a leap of faith, followed her gut and worked her butt off — all because she believed in something big — the possibility to improve lives and make a positive difference in the world.Looking back on her life, it all makes perfect sense. She was born to do what she does. It wasn’t always that way however. But things began to change for Amanda when she made a firm decision to just start surrounding herself with positive, inspiring people committed to advancing change. Over time, Amanda began to exude the wavelength of these new associations, providing her with the courage and self belief to then channel that positivity into her dream — the creation of a new community of paradigm-busting thought leaders leveraging technology and relationships to forge positive social, economic, educational and civic change in urban centers across the nation.Disillusioned with traditional modalities of education in the wake of receiving her masters degree in curriculum, Amanda began her professional career as an event planner for various restaurants in New York City. Blessed with natural people skills and an innate talent for getting crowds of cool people to show up where she wanted them to show up, Amanda started to think about how she could channel this facility for good. Her first big dream was realized when she helped birth the first  Global Citizen Festival  — a now annual concert series in New York City’s Central Park that draws 60,000 attendees and this September will feature Jay-Z, No Doubt, Carrie Underwood, fun., The Roots and Tiësto.This experience ultimately led Amanda to some very interesting posts as both a brand and event consultant with incredible organizations like Life Is Beautiful  (Las Vegas’ version of the Global Citizen Festival) and  Summit Series  — a series of events and a growing community of inspiring thought leaders that catalyze entrepreneurship, achievement and positive global change (as someone who has spent time with the Summit community, I can attest to the power of this unique and incredible organization).But her biggest accomplishments were yet to come.I first met Amanda about a year ago when she invited me out to something called Catalyst Week, a monthly event she personally curates and hosts through her company Catalyst Creativ  that brings inspiring thought leaders to Downtown Las Vegas to share and contribute to the Downtown Project – a movement launched by Zappos CEO Tony Hseih to revitalize the downtown sector of Las Vegas into a vibrant community of entrepreneurship, artistry and commerce. The bigger vision? The creation of a scaleable model than can be replicated to revitalize underserved urban centers across the country.Participating in Catalyst Week was an extraordinary and moving experience for me personally. And I was so impressed by Amanda’s passion, advocacy, spirit and results, I knew I had to have her on the show.We live in this Kardashian-obsessed culture where mainstream media inclines towards the lowest denominator in women at the expense of the countless incredible female role models doing amazing things to make the world a better place. As a father of two young girls, it’s not just my pleasure and honor to celebrate Amanda, it’s my responsibility.Amanda’s message is both powerful and inspirational. I’m proud to bring it to you today.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

Someone you respect and admire. Someone who exudes the qualities you would like to possess. Someone who has what you want. Set aside your fears and apprehensions, approach that person and simply ask for guidance. Stop waiting for that person to call you or ask you. Do the footwork. Make it happen.

August 24, 2014

It’s been a crazy week. This past Monday, we launched our new iOS mobile app to immediate and rave reviews, posted our 100th episode and surpassed 3 million podcast downloads.Pretty awesome, thanks entirely to you guys — the audience. Most appreciated. But how did all these momentous milestones mysteriously transpire on the exact same day?I call this the principle of Universal Synchronicity.In my book, I wrote something like, “when purpose aligns with faith, the Universe will conspire to support you” (actually I don’t remember exactly what I said and right now I’m too lazy to look it up, but I digress). Toss service into the equation and that’s when stuff gets really crazy. My version of the age-old precept (and again I am paraphrasing), give of yourself freely and you will receive tenfold in return.I don’t know why – it doesn’t make sense in the context of our logical three-dimensional world based in fact and physical laws like gravity. But that doesn’t change the fact that these karmic principles seem to indeed be law. Spiritual tenets I suppose. Truths you can’t touch, feel, see or hear. And yet without a doubt they are undeniable certitudes.The aforementioned events in my life are a small thing in the context of life. They really don’t mean that much. And easy to chalk up as mere “coincidence.” But through direct experience I know better. Cosmic signals. Roadsigns along the journey. I am being supported. And for that I am incredibly grateful.When you begin to pay attention — I mean center your attention, turn off the chattering mind, get present and really tune in to your environment — you begin to realize that even the tiniest observations, events and exchanges can carry meaning. Not always. And not necessarily in any external sense, but with the implication that everything is evidence — forensic tools to help calibrate the compass of your life’s trajectory.To put things in perspective, I don’t have enough fingers and toes to count the number of times I have found myself in a metaphorical canoe without a paddle – unsure where I was being directed and just surrendering to the current, present and open to what might come downriver and proceeding only on intuition, instinct and faith.Every time I allow myself to get out of the way, simply let go and allow, I end up someplace unexpected. This is not to be mistaken for giving up. In my experience it takes great courage to surrender the reins of control. And at the time it might not seem like it leads to such a great a place. I might (often?) temporally judge it as disastrous. But with the passage of time and the onset of objectivity, it’s almost unilaterally something great. Typically a better situation I could never have anticipated. And inevitably a superior outcome than I would have handpicked for myself if given the opportunity to dictate the result.By contrast, when I am clinging to ego, fueled by character defects, self will, self-interest or base impulse (which is more often that I care to admit, although I guess I am admitting it now), my instincts are unreliable. My intuition is adrift. The result? The Universe will inevitably deliver me the lesson I need, which generally involves enduring a proper right-sizing. Time for another compass recalibration.In either case, it’s always and without fail exactly where I am meant to be. I know this to be true because every time I peer into my rear view, it always adds up. Good or bad, the math is inevitably perfect. I wish I could access this perspective looking forward, but for whatever reason life just doesn’t work that way. That kind of sucks. But it’s also kind of great.If I lost you, I get it. I still struggle mightily with these ideas. Too new age for me broseph – I’m out!If you are still with me, I get that too. So how can I begin the process of getting right with myself?I always say the best (and easiest) place to begin is with the food on your plate; what you put in your mouth. Change that vibration for the better and you just might be amazed by the extent to which your precious compass will begin to mysteriously recalibrate itself. A powerful baseline to begin anew; reconsider your life. And embrace the new journey that follows.That’s my story. And it’s also the story of today’s guest – a guy who had a passion for healthy, clean, performance enhancing nutrition that catalyzed quite an amazing, unexpected journey to becoming recognized as one of the most prominent modern voices, athletes and entrepreneurs and authors in the world of health, fitness and nutrition.Recognized as one of the world’s foremost authorities on plant-based nutrition and sports performance, it’s fair to say that Brendan is the guy leading the charge in the plant-based athletic performance kingdom. To be sure, he was the first guy I looked to personally (and continue to do so) for guidance, information, support and inspiration when I began exploring the nexus between performance and athleticism on a diet fueled entirely on plants. And suffice to say I’m not alone in this regard. It’s no understatement to say that Brendan deserves ample credit for truly galvanizing this global plantpowered evolution/revolution — his books, products and message largely responsible for unleashing thousands of of eager plant-based athletes into the wild…Former professional ironman triathlete. 2-time Canadian 50K Ultrarunning champion. Formulator and face behind the wildly successful, ubiquitous and award-winning Vega line of plant-based nutritional products. Partner in the Zön Fitness Program and founder of  Thrive Foods Direct – a nationwide plant-based foods delivery service. Corporate and university guest lecturer and in demand public speaker on all things plant-based, Brendan has even spoken before the U.S. Congress. Bestselling author of the Thrive  book series. Not enough? Brendan was also named one of the Top 40 Under 40 list of most influential people in the health industry by Natural Food Merchandise and serves as a successful performance consultant to world class, Olympic and professional athletes of all type and shape, including professional MMA fighters, cyclists, cycling teams like Garmin Sharp, and players in the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL.His latest venture? Thrive Magazine, a publication whose mission statement reads: to give all who aspire to continually improve the inspiration, tools, resources, and community to do so. Sound familiar? Indeed. I like to think of Thrive as a glossy print version of what I do my best to offer through this podcast — in depth interviews with the most innovative, inspiring people and personalities working to change the face of health, athletics, nutrition, creativity and entrepreneurship.But beyond the labels, the books, the accomplishments, the accolades and the entrepreneurial success, at his core Brendan is simply a guy devoted to service – his compass properly calibrated to educate and inspire all people to access and embrace a more ethical, environmentally friendly, and healthy lifestyle. In certain respects, as he so candidly discloses during the course of our conversation, he is a most unlikely successful entrepreneur.To bring it full circle, Brendan is a man who embodies this principle of Universal Synchronicity: a man driven by purpose; fueled by faith in said purpose; and devoted to service. And so it comes as no surprise that the Universe has conspired to support him. And in Brendan’s success we all benefit.Brendan isn’t just an inspiration, he’s a friend I am proud to champion. I’m really pleased and honored to share his story with you today. Even if you think you know the guy, I assure you this conversation is different. I sincerely hope you enjoy the offering.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates. No spam.

August 17, 2014

100 EPISODES!Wow. I can’t believe how amazing this podcast journey has been.Over the last week, I have been flooded with inquiries on social media – so who is going to be the special guest for the big episode 100?A lot of speculation. Big names getting thrown around with anticipatory question marks. I understand the appeal. But this landmark has me sentimental. Thinking a lot about what was going on in my life when I made the decision to start this show. And when perceived through this lens, there is only one person appropriate to sit across from me for 100 — the same person who sat across from me for #1.Julie Piatt.The wheel turns. We come full circle. Revisit. Reflect. Give thanks. And move forward.So much has changed since November 2012 when the show launched. To take a quantum leap forward, we must connect with and better understand the past. So I went back and listened to that very first offering — for the first time since I recorded it. Admittedly rough. Unpolished. Nervous energy, echo chamber audio and uncertainty converging in a vacant warehouse on an organic farm on the north shore of Kauai. Just me, Julie, a couple really bad mics and no expectations or idea as to where this leap would land.And yet I was dumbstruck by just how much the show has stayed true to the seed I planted that day.I vividly recall that day. My son Tyler and my nephew Harrison jerry-rigging their musical equipment to manage the audio. I remember the theme music they wrote and recorded in the warehouse just hours before the first show — a riff they came up without much thought and always intended as “temp” until they wrote something better. Julie and I sitting across from each other, wondering just what we might talk about.Two years later and I’m astonished at just how little has changed. Today Ty (who is now my producer and the guy behind all the show music) and Harrison strummed guitars and checked audio levels as I set up in our garage. That temp theme music still begins each episode. And Julie and I still stare across at each other before every show we do together, wondering just what the conversation might bring.But what really struck me about that first episode is that my improvised introduction and meandering thoughts, words, intentions and aspirations for what the show might become mirror exactly what the show has indeed become 100 episodes and hundreds of recorded hours later — compelling long-form conversations with inspiring, paradigm busting minds and personalities in health, wellness, nutrition, fitness, entrepreneurship, creativity and spirituality with one singular goal – to help you discover, uncover, unlock and unleash your best, most authentic self.Although I know I have gotten better at this, I still consider myself rather amateur behind the mic. But I’m proud of the show we’ve built. A show that has promoted dialog around new ideas. A toolbox of inspiration and education for transcending your circumstances. A platform for unlocking your inner potential – in whatever form that may be – by introducing and discussing new (sometimes controversial or fringe) ideas with the hope that you will take what resonates with you and not only use it, but share it.The Power of CommunityI send the show out into the ether every week. But it’s you, the audience, who has taken what alone is nothing more than an inert digital file comprised of ones and zeroes — and fertilized it. A seed you have fostered into something much bigger and more important than a simple weekly .mp3. Something remarkable:Community.When I think back on the history of the show to date, it’s crystal clear what is truly important. And most beautiful. A global water cooler around which we can connect over a myriad of ideas with one collective goal — be and do better. Together.Community. That’s what today’s show is all about.No matter what your goal or aspiration – irrespective of how solitary you believe its pursuit – you simply cannot truly score on your own. Everyone needs a team. Everyone needs a support network. Everyone needs help. Everyone needs a Board of Advisors.Birth family or soul family. Children or parents. Friends or co-workers. Clubs or crews. The shape and form of these networks of support mean less than the quality of the individuals that comprise them.The point is this: when your team is intact, in alignment, supportive and strong, miracles can occur.Together we are one. Together we are strong. Together we can change the world.Let’s Talk About GratitudeWith the reflection that comes with milestones I am overwhelmed with gratitude. Let this 100th episode serve as a big thank you to all of you out there who have helped me along the path. Without a doubt, this includes you – the listener. Thank you for your courage; for taking the leap; and walking this journey alongside me. Thank you for putting wind in my sails by tuning in week after week.And thank you for giving me hope in the good — the promise of a better more fulfilling, legacy worthy purpose here on Earth in this short life.But most of all, thank you for letting me serve. Because it is in service that I find purpose, meaning and a sense of deep satisfaction that positively infuses every aspect of my daily life experience.I Want To Hear From You (Plus Giveaway!)In addition, I want to thank each and every one of you — and there are many — who have taken the time to reach out and share with me your challenges, victories and struggles. I cannot overstate the extent to which your experiences humble me; hold me accountable for my own actions; inspire me to do and be better; and ennoble me to soldier on in the face of whatever obstacles I may face.Which brings me to an idea..If you have been positively influenced by this show to make a personally significant change in your life, I want to hear your story. If you’re up for sharing, please weave your tale in the comments section below. If you’d rather remain anonymous (I get it), then e-mail your testimony to findingultra@gmail.com (I am the only person who will see these e-mails and your confidence will not be shared). To the extent of your willingness to be vulnerable, let it all hang out: the struggles you faced, how you overcame and how this show might have played a (small part).I’m not looking to take any credit whatsoever for anybody’s journey. Any improvements you made to your life, well that’s on you entirely. Hats off and head bowed in reverence. I just love the stories. It helps me feel more connected to you. It helps dry the cement on this community bond I am trying to foster – a bond over just being better.I promise to read everything. Then I’ll pick 3 and send the chosen a sweet care package of thanks and congratulations. Because giving back is what it means to be part of a community.This week is about honoring just that. It’s what this show is — and has always been — all about.I sincerely hope you enjoy this 100th conversation. And again, thank you.

“Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames.”RumiI like to think this show sparks that fire by seeking out and sharing the stories of those who fan my flames. A mixed bag of inspiration and education. A diversity of in-depth conversations: life experiences, incredible personal stories, tales of transformation and a wealth of information to light your personal path towards maximum life satisfaction. A grab-bag toolbox to help you escape the status quo doldrums of life, raise your personal vibration and simply live better.At the end of the day, it’s all about story. Others sharing theirs so you can begin to reframe, tell and live a better story of yourself.It’s easy to keep doing what you’re doing, propelled by a story you tell yourself about yourself, in whatever shape or form that may take. Life has a momentum like that. A particular gestalt. The relentless pressures and priorities of daily life take over and before we even consciously realize it, we fall victim to a rut we justify under the rubric of routine.The rut is easy. It’s the default imprimatur of social acceptance. Do what you’re told. Don’t ask questions. Shut up and keep shopping. Play that video game. Escape. And numb out your latent voice; your inner potential; and the world at large.To escape this prison we must first change the story. This begins with the inside work. Investigate what makes you the only you there is. Develop a sense of self that renders your intuition not just reliable, but the only true compass directing your path. Walk through the fear that constrains the emergence of the true self. Unleash the courage to blaze your own path. And execute. Because talk is cheap. And action is everything.Doing this is hard. Maybe the hardest thing you will ever do, it’s like a salmon swimming upstream. Or setting sail in stormy seas in a canoe without a paddle.But let’s flip our perspective and view this path through a new pair of glasses. Not from a perspective of struggle and hardship but instead as more of a letting go. Rather than fight, surrender. Rather than climb a mountain, let’s fall into who you really are. A natural process as effortless as a snake shedding an old skin.This is what faith is all about. It’s about understanding that that shed skin will soon be replaced with a new one that fits more perfectly. It’s about being comfortable that that perilous, oar-less canoe will somehow self-orient to flow in the current of your true life purpose. And the idea that when the sea settles, you will find yourself no longer in that rut, but effortlessly gliding in a special, secret current with your name on it. The eddy of your personal life purpose if you will.I realize of course that this all sounds counter-intuitive, if not downright weird. Letting go to ascend? Surrendering for the win? Hippy-dippy new-age crap! I get it. I used to feel the same. It took me years to really understand that it is the firm grip — attachment to ideas and behaviors — that keeps us stuck. And that freedom comes when we let go and release that grip and our attachment to behaviors and patterns and beliefs we mistakenly presume comprise our identity. These are truths. Spiritual laws if you will. Incredibly powerful tools I have used to get and stay sober; change my life path; and become more fully myself. Keys I continue to rely on daily to constantly challenge myself to grow and expand my horizons.This is all a long way of saying that we all have the power to just start telling a new story about ourselves.This is what  Robin Arzón  is all about.A self-proclaimed Ambassador Of Sweat, Robin is so many things: the inspirational voice behind her blog  SHUTUPANDRUN, a NYC-based urban, bridge-running force of nature, an accomplished ultramarathoner (she once ran 5 marathons in 5 days across Utah), running coach, cycling instructor, as well as brand ambassador and social media producer, consulting with some of the biggest brands in the world, like Nike, Adidas and Puma.And now Robin can add magazine founder and publisher to her resume with the recent release of UNDO Magazine. Where sweat meets culture, the new rag can be found worldwide in places like Urban Outfitters.Hailing from Cuban and Puerto Rican parents, I would call Robin a modern day seeker clad in sweat and the latest fashions of the day, fueled by the ethos that there is no finish line. On a mission to redefine, reform, and rethink possibility through movement, Robin is a proper role model of female empowerment who never sacrifices style for function, bringing the bling, swagger, fashion and fun back to sweat, running and fitness with an infectious energy, personal zeal and unique style that is completely her own — quintessentially urban, completely NYC, totally hip, impossibly infectious, and totally inclusive.And now Robin is facing a new challenge. Recently diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, she’s taking her fight and irrepressible swagger to a new level of focus to serve and inspire to others.What I find personally fascinating is that just two years ago, Robin was living a completely different life — toiling away in obscurity as a very well compensated corporate lawyer at one of the world’s biggest and most prestigious law firms. Replete in high heels and business suits, her life was a revolving door of high-stakes deals, 80-hour workweeks, power lunches and skyscrapers. Needless to say it would have been easy for Robin to spend the rest of her days hammering huge paychecks and living an opulent New York City lifestyle.But this was not her path. It wasn’t her passion. I think it’s safe to say that at the time, Robin wasn’t quite sure about what exactly she wanted out of life. But she did know one thing – she loved to run. And she had faith in one motto: we become what we commit to.A near-death experience being held hostage at gunpoint several years prior helped place the preciousness of life into proper perspective for Robin, ultimately infusing her with the courage to take a leap into the void. And two years ago she did just that. Much like last week’s guest Evan Rock – and to continue on a theme — Robin simply up and walked out on her secure, prosperous and upwardly mobile career — letting it all go to step into the unknown of a completely new life without a roadmap beyond her intuition, passion, hustle and swagger. To set foot into that canoe without a paddle and let the current take her, with only one item on her to do list: do epic shit.I’m so happy to have Robin in my life as a friend. And as a father of two little girls, I am inspired by her shining example of positive female empowerment amidst the fetid morass of our Kardashian-influenced culture.Full time dreamer. Part-time hustler. How did Robin – to coin her hashtag — “undo ordinary” and change the story she tells about herself? It’s time to find out.I am super excited to share Robin with you today and sincerely hope she inspires you to tell your own story.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

August 4, 2014

Today we go off-grid.As some of you know, this show was launched from a yurt on Hawaii. It was about a year and half ago. At the time, we were at a crossroads. Unsure about our family’s future in Los Angeles, we were looking for something new and different. Then out of the blue, a unique opportunity arose and we seized it. An opportunity for myself, my wife and our kids to see and embrace a different approach to life.Next thing we knew, we found ourselves living at Common Ground— a living, breathing organic farm on the north shore of Kauai. For three months we ate and lived off the land (well, mostly). Our kids learned farming and permaculture harvesting food in the gardens. We cohabited in communal yurts shared with a bevy of energetic young people passionate about the environment, sustainability, food and soil. All told, we embraced a completely new and different experience of daily existence, cementing the idea that we have choice when it comes to lifestyle. The notion that — all of the plenty excuses aside — we don’t have to live the way everyone else does.A powerful concept we wanted our kids to see, understand and experience on a fundamental, tactile level.It takes courage to step outside the norm. In our case, we obviously returned to Los Angeles. In all honesty, I just wasn’t ready for that level of disconnect on a permanent basis at this stage in my life. But that doesn’t mean it wasn’t invaluable, because it was — an experience I will always treasure and never forget. It’s an understatement to say that it broadened my horizons. As a family unit, we were permanently changed. A powerful and constant reminder that there is another way. Always another way.During our time on Kauai, I got a call from my friend Evan Rock.A successful young, enterprising commercial real estate executive, I first met Evan when he was dating the young woman who frequently babysits for our little girls. I didn’t know much about him at that time, other than that Evan was a young man with a plan. Dreams of making it big financially. Driving a Porsche and living large. But not too dissimilar from me, Evan happened to be undergoing his own personal transformation. Something Julie calls dismantling. Taking stock of his life, he began to critically evaluate how he was spending his time. He discovered meditation. Unlocking, he then started asking himself questions — big questions. What am I doing and why? What makes me truly happy? How can I better serve myself, my fellow man and the planet?This practice soon led Evan to yoga, then plant-based nutrition. An increase in vitality led him to fitness, even dipping his toe into triathlon. As he continued to search and expand, he ultimately adopted a full fledged high-carb fruitarian lifestyle.I’ll never forget running into him at Whole Foods in Tarzana about two years ago. Clad in suit & tie on break from his commercial real estate firm across the street, I watched Evan devour an entire watermelon for lunch to the bemusement of fellow lunch-goers.This is a long way of saying that Evan was undergoing some fundamental, core changes and looking for more. During that phone call I could hear the earnestness in his voice. Mental gears turning, Evan expressed a deep curiosity about the hows and whys of what we were doing in Kauai. I could tell a plan was starting to hatch in his mind.Fast forward to about 5 months ago when I discovered that Evan hadn’t just quit his job, he completely cashed out of his comfortable life of financial security. The new owner of a nice chunk of property on the Hilo side of the Big Island of Hawaii, he just up and moved there.Just Evan, a tractor and pickup truck with a tarp to cover the flatbed where he slept. Completely off-grid, his new home could only be described as a completely overgrown, seemingly inhospitable parcel of untouched tropical jungle in the middle of a nowhere paradise. And yet a piece of land teeming with potential. The potential for a completely new life for himself — and eventually others.By day Evan worked tirelessly to clear the land. By night he slept on the back of his truck, often soaked by the nightly rain showers. And with the help of friends he eventually met on island, Evan recently built a tiny one room shelter that can only be loosely described as a “house”. Newly christened Fruition Hawaii, the land is now home to several like-minded young people living as a collective. A potent seed germinating Evan’s vision of creating a conscious community and retreat center.Even more fascinating is that Evan has been documenting the entire process in real time on YouTube  where you can see the project unfold from it’s inception.Whether this is your vibe or not, you simply cannot deny the courage it takes to execute upon the life that dwells in your creative imagination. The spine required to turn off autopilot; seize the reins of your personal destiny; and put action into vision. I’m not talking about the life expected of you, nor the life you think you are supposed to lead. I’m talking about the life of your wildest dreams.Evan Rock completely removed himself from one life and boldly entered a new one.  A life divorced from the familiar trappings and distractions of modern urban existence and instead premised on nourishment of body, mind and spirit; a philosophy of abundance; a deepening of awareness; and most of all — love.Ready to go off grid?

July 27, 2014

Everyone loves a good transformation story.We like it even better when it’s super dramatic. Preferably framed to appear like it all went down like some kind of overnight miracle. Bonus points for million dollar paydays, instantaneous cures, extreme but effortless weight loss and age reversal.But that’s just not how this stuff works, people.Growth and change are hard. And never overnight. It’s a process. 2, 3, 5 even 10 steps backwards for every single step in the right direction. Rinse & repeat, generally in obscurity. It requires dedication, faith, time, toil and pain — because getting out of your comfort zone is just that: uncomfortable. It means taking an honest look in the mirror and objectively evaluating your unpleasantries, missteps and weaknesses. Shedding light on blind spots. And grappling with demons, hardwired patterns and deeply ingrained perspectives on ourselves and our place in the world.But change is also simple. It begins with a basic a decision to do (or not do) something; anything. A decision generally followed by tiny — sometimes almost imperceptible — changes in behavior made consistently over extended periods of time.In other words, the trite annoying adage is true. Baby steps do move mountains.True, sustainable personal growth rarely comes about by changing everything overnight. Instead, it’s about exploring and ultimately developing some level of mastery over just a few small yet important shifts – or even just one aspect of how you spend your time each day. Adopt this approach – a slight shift in perspective and behavior – and you just might be amazed at how impactful this can be on your life experience. How you see, feel about and ultimately interact with yourself, others and the world at large.Do this — and like today’s guest — you just might find yourself 10% Happier*.Dan Harris.This guy is impressive. Young and ambitious, Dan joined ABC News in 2000 and quickly rose through the ranks under the mentorship of broadcasting legends Peter Jennings and Diane Sawyer. Today he balances duties as co-anchor of ABC News’ Nightline  and co-anchor of the weekend edition of Good Morning America  on top of filing reports and filling in on air throughout the week on various ABC News programs.Along the way, Dan has covered some huge stories. He reported on the mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, Aurora, Colorado and Tucson, Arizona, and anchored natural disasters from Haiti to Myanmar to Hurricane Katrina. He has also covered combat in Afghanistan, Israel, Gaza and the West Bank, including six visits to war-torn Iraq.The job is a relentless pressure cooker. The stress mounted, compounded by multiple tours as an embedded journalist in conflict ridden areas of the Middle East. Depression ensued, followed by self-medicating with recreational use of cocaine and ecstasy. Ultimately, these factors conspired to take a serious toll on Dan’s mental and physical health. And it’s here that things get interesting.In June 2004, it all caught up with Dan (as these things are wont to do), ultimately manifesting in a very public panic attack on national TV – on Good Morning America of all shows — in front of 5 million people.He wasn’t sure what was wrong with him, only that he knew he had to make some changes. Around this time, in a bizarre stroke of synchronicity, Peter Jennings assigned Dan to start covering stories on faith, religion and spirituality. Ugh. A lifelong nonbeliever, let’s just say Dan was less than thrilled. But what ensued was a bizarre, unexpected adventure into the subculture of mega church pastors, self-help gurus, and brain scientists that eventually led Dan to understand that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head.  A thinking mind which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business yet also led him to make the decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out.We all have that voice in our head. It’s what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we’re not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we’re stuck with this voice – that there’s nothing we can do to rein it in – but Dan stumbled upon an effective way to do just that.A protocol he always assumed to be either impossible or useless:Meditation. That’s right people. We’re back to meditation. Do you detect a theme here??After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Dan took a leap of faith. A deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even prison guards and marines who are now using it for increased calm, focus, and happiness.Dan’s a great guy and it was super fun to sit down with him in his NYC Nightline office the other week to hear all about this adventure. An adventure he chronicles in his highly entertaining and illuminating memoir called – you guessed it – 10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works–A True Story*.It’s a fun book that delves into the inner workings of national network news as Dan recounts how he stopped using drugs (always a favorite topic of mine), discovered the benefits of meditation (again, a recurrent theme of this show), and resolved the apparent conflict between meditation-induced equanimity and the aggressive competitiveness required for success as a TV-news journalist (something I continue to struggle with).For a quick primer on what’s in store prior to tuning in to the conversation, check him out on The Colbert Report, then treat yourself to this highly entertaining 15 minute talk Dan gave at the recent MindBodyGreen Revitalize Summit:Let’s step into the world of Dan Harris.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

July 21, 2014

Finding balance in life. Developing trust in something bigger than yourself. Surrendering your self-will. Relying on faith to guide you. And the courage to risk it all for the sake of living your best, most authentic life.Today marks the return of my erstwhile co–host, mother of my children and my wife of 11 years.Julie Piatt.Last week we celebrated our anniversary by renewing our vows. A small little ceremony with just the kids, it was a meaningful way to pay tribute to this journey we’ve taken. Bringing the kids into the equation, all six of us took the opportunity to share our own “vows” by expressing gratitude for what each member of the family brings to our communal band.It’s important to create ceremony around seminal moments. To pause. And take the time to honor each other. It was profound.  An event that brought us all closer to each other. And more connected to the journey ahead.After being married for many years its easy to fall into cruise control – my across the board default mode. Whether its fitness, diet, profession, relationships, or (in my case) sobriety, it doesn’t take much to convince ourselves that everything is cool, then ease off the gas.Personally, taking things for granted is my pastime. Avoiding this pitfall is a daily practice that demands a level of focused consciousness around all aspects of my life to help me understand that there is always improvement to be had. That growth requires constant work and pressure and focus.But a crucial truism I learned very early on in recovery is that there is no stasis. In every given moment you are either growing or regressing. Moving towards a drink or away from a drink. Heading towards something better or lapsing backwards into bad habits, behaviors, addictions, assumptions, modalities, whatever.Without attention, my life can quickly spiral out of balance. Prone to obsessiveness, it’s my nature to lose myself. To become so immersed in what I am doing, whatever it is – training, writing, podcasting – that I lose sight of the bigger picture. Other aspects of my busy life that require my attention. And more often than not, these aspects are the most important aspects.Balance — the primary topic of today’s conversation — is the fickle lover I am always courting yet struggle mightily to master. It’s like squeezing a water ballon. Just when you think you’ve got it compressed, something pops out. Squeeze the bulge down and it pops up somewhere else. Always see-sawing from over focusing on one aspect of my life at the distress of another. Story of my life.The more work I do on myself, the better and bigger my life gets. With this comes more opportunities to get out of balance. Which means even more work to keep all the plates spinning at the same speed.  The irony.Of course we all struggle with balancing our busy lives. It’s not easy. So today is all about trying to better understand the mechanics behind maintaining proper life balance to avoid the common pitfalls. And keep us on track, moving in the right direction.Julie — a much more innately balanced person than I – is perfectly suited for this conversation, always helping me see the objective truth of how I am acting and helping me bring things into focus. She is bursting with wisdom on the subject so I though this would make for a very dynamic and hopefully helpful conversation for you.Finally, it’s only apropos that today (Monday July 21) also happens to be Julie’s birthday. I didn’t plan it that way, just a tiny example of how Julie seems to effortlessly roll in harmony.  So give her a shoutout on Twitter.  Or better yet, check out her newly launched website SriMati,com. If you dig where she’s coming from, she will be posting spiritual nuggets, recipes and stories only the way she can tell them. Not to mention music. Don’t forget to give her new album Jai Home  a listen. The title track ends this week’s episode.Let’s dive down this balance cave and see where it takes us.I hope you enjoy the listen.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

An early adopter, I have been posting my own “stories” every day or so for public viewing — fun little amateurish snippets on training, food, nutrition and general family life. Some take you on a bike ride in the mountains. On trail runs and the places I travel. Others are just fun with the kids. So if you want to take a peek behind the scenes into our life in the form of a constantly disappearing vlog if you will (Snapchat “stories” only live for 24 hours before disappearing forever), download the Snapchat app to your smartphone and add me at: iamrichrollPPS — This is not a sponsor deal.

463,John Joseph & Mishka Shubaly,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-95-explicit-john-joseph-mishka-shubaly-the-post-punk-algonquin-round-table-peace-plants-pma/,"Episode 95
July 14, 2014

Oh snap — s*$%t is about to get real!Back by popular demand, I am overjoyed to bring together two of my most popular repeat guests on the RRP — John Joseph and Mishka Shubaly— for an epic threesome.Call it my Post-Punk Algonquin Round Table: uncensored ruminations NYC style on sobriety, writing books, eating plants, running ridiculously long distances, expanding consciousness, walking a spiritual path and PMA — John’s personal mantra for positive mental attitude.I cannot overstate how much I love these guys. And on the mic they never disappoint.As you might suspect, the Cro-Mags’ frontman aka Bloodclot returns to do what he does best — incite, provoke, educate and entertain. Straight talk directly from the streets of the Lower East Side with one singular, driving purpose: getting people to “wake the f&*k up”, expand consciousness and take control of our lives.Not to be outdone, Mishka fills the co-host role today and holds his own with JJ (not easy), rounding out the conversation with his always humorous, astute observations on the creative, athletic, sober life.But the predominant subject of today’s show revolves around the release of John’s new book — a completely updated and rewritten version of his previously self-published cult hit: Meat Is For Pussies: A How To Guide For Dudes Who Want to Get Fit, Kick Ass and Take Names*If you’re a long-time listener to the show, my boys need no introduction. If you’re new and unfamiliar with these phenomenons, I urge you to check out my earlier introductory posts and tune into their multiple previous appearances (hyperlinks to previous shows in the below Notes).As for JJ, suffice it to say the guy is a true American original.  Lower East Side thief, abuse survivor, drug dealer & brawling gutter rat reborn as spiritual warrior. CBGB Street Poet. Punk-ass Robin Hood. Plantpowered Ironman. Spiritual evangelist.A life story so astounding, I can only describe it like this:“Take a little Charles Bukowski, add some Hugh Selby, Jr., throw in a little Jerry Stahl and finish it off with a light dusting of Paramahansa Yogananda. Then toss them all in a Martin Scorcese movie, douse the whole thing in kerosene and light it on fire. That is John Joseph.”But John is also one of the most spiritual, giving cats I have ever met. The guy who will always engage a stranger on the street; and literally move mountains to help a less fortunate soul in need — and never ask for anything in return.A the end of the day, all you really need to know about John is condensed into this little gem that recently appeared on Vice.com— the most entertaining “how to make a green smoothie” video of all time:Meditation; service; sobriety; GMO’s; the “V” word; the nutritional plight of the everyman; balancing life as both an athlete and creative person; and what it means to truly be a man — these are the topics of the day.  And yes, we address head-on the heated controversy swirling around the title of John’s new book. My opinion? This is a great book. It’s not written for the converted. It’s written for the guy who wouldn’t pick up VegNews Magazine if it was the only thing left on the entire planet to read. This book will not be everyone’s cup of tea. But it’s a book I have no doubt will transform the lives of countless thousands. Because Meat Is For Pussies connects the dots for even the most hardened meat eating, carnivorous BBQ-loving dude imaginable.It was my honor to write the foreword to this work. It was my honor to introduce John at his book release party in Brooklyn this week. And it is my honor to have Mishka and John join me today to discuss and celebrate his awesome achievement.I’m proud to call these guys my friends and am always thrilled to bring their unique, compelling voices to you.FINAL NOTE: This episode is EXPLICIT for profane language. John cannot and will not be edited or muzzled — nor would you want him to be. He drops the f-bomb about a thousand times during the interview so if you are easily offended, I’m warning you now.  Let’s just say it’s NSFW — so if the kiddies are around or you’re at work, I might suggest popping the earbuds in.I sincerely hope you enjoy the show.Peace, Plants and — in the words of John Joseph — PMA!Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

“I think our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. I think we’re run by maniacs for maniacal ends. I think they’re all insane. But I am liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That’s what’s insane about it.”John LennonI started this show because I truly believe that too many of us are wasting our lives in a reflexive daze. Disconnected from who we are, what makes our hearts beat and what we truly need to be happy. Just trying to make it through the day intact. Pay the bills. And make ends meet so we can numb out to Dancing With The Stars. Living for the weekend, we celebrate by getting drunk and then do it all over again. You know what I’m talking about.It’s no way to live. Believe me, I tried.Remember when you were a kid? No older than 11 when the world was wide open. Everything was amazing. Even the tiniest of things could provoke endless fascination. Pure joy in the simplest of activities like running around in the yard with a garden hose; jumping off a diving board into a pool or riding your bike around the neighborhood with friends. The effortless ability to be truly present in the world. Gifted with an innate sense of wonder – and a moral compass that naturally understood right from wrong, good from bad.Then we grow up. That child falls by the wayside. Drops away. Or simply becomes repressed as we morph out of that natural state of what it is to be fundamentally alive, only to step into the objective, material fear-based world of ego, status, and comparison that leaves us obsessed with the past and maniacally pre-occupied with the future yet never fully present in the now.This is the chronic collective human condition today’s guest calls being lost in the rational world. A state of being that all too often leaves us anxious, afraid, depressed, isolated, lonely and sometimes even desperate – resigned to a life we’re not sure we ever really even signed up for.I know what that’s like. I’ve been there.  And so has today’s guest.But there is a way out.  Because that inner child is still there – lurking deep down. We just have to find a way to access it. Tap in. Find a way to bring it to the surface. Unlock and unleash it.This is the path to the authentic self. This is the path to wholeness. This is what it means to be alive. And happy – not in a blissed out unicorns kind of way but in the sense that your life has directed meaning – a purpose that brings true satisfaction.SLOMO.That’s right people. Slomo.What the hell is a Slomo? It’s not what. It’s who.I first became aware of this world class character when an award-winning short documentary about a very strange man by an enterprising young filmmaker named Josh Izenberg landed on the home page of the New York Times at the end of March.What followed was 16 minutes of pure unadulterated awe-inspiring beauty about a man going boldly where most men fear to venture – letting go of all the trappings of his comfortable, previous existence to instead to pursue the simplest of lives. A life based on faith, purity, movement and the pursuit of what he calls “The Zone” – in his own highly unique and incredibly peculiar way.I implore you – before listening to this episode, please watch this short documentary. The experience of our conversation just won’t be complete without it.Born John Kitchin, Slomo is a spry and vigorous 71-year old dude raised on a dairy farm in North Carolina. He was a top student at Duke and Wake Forest Medical School before building an incredibly successful neurology practice in Southern California. The kind of wild success that begets BMW’s, Ferarris, multiple mansions and even a Neverland Ranch-esque exotic animal farm.The kind of success that can, well, in the words of Slomo, make you an asshole.And by his own admission, that’s exactly what John Kitchin was – an asshole.Then something happened. A strange confluence of events that included a random encounter with a 91-year old patient and – quite ironically — the onset of his own neurological disorder that compelled him to take a long hard look at how he was pursuing his short time here on Earth.Victimized by a rare and strange condition called Prosopagnosia – that weird thing you might have heard of where suddenly you simply cannot recognize faces anymore made famous by Dr. Oliver Sacks and shared by people like Kurt Vonnegut, Tom Stoppard and artist Chuck Close (one of my favorites) — Kitchin found himself in a twist of irony a novelist would envy.Neurologically impaired, the neurologist became the neurology patient.What could have been perceived as a disastrous turn of events instead became John’s moment of truth. His line in the sand moment. A door cracked open, he saw it as a sacred, divinely inspired opportunity — and seized it.Unable to continue his former life, he quit his job. Then he sold all of his possessions.  The Ferrari and the BMW? Gone. The exotic animal farm? Bye bye. The mansions? Sold. Then he moved to a tiny one room studio apartment ½ block from the Pacific Beach boardwalk in San Diego.But this was no mere downsizing or simple self-promise to slow down and start smelling the roses.  It was a decision to become an entirely new person altogether. A firm commitment to pursue the remainder of his days based upon one singular, fundamental premise:Do what you love.For John, this edict translated to one very specific activity: skating.That’s right. Rollerblading.  All day.  Every day.Exit John.  Enter Slomo.Developing a unique and admittedly bizarre slow motion gliding style that looks like a flying Warrior 3 yoga pose, Slomo found himself inhabiting a rare state of consciousness he dubs “The Zone” – a deep meditative state where both time and objectivity become fluid, amorphous constructs. A certain sense of transcendence catalyzed by the lateral motion of his body impacting the tiny bones of his inner ear that dictate the body’s innate sense of balance. A self-styled moving meditation that allows him to tap into what spiritualist Eckhart Tolle would call  The Power of Now*. Or as Slomo would put it, riding the tip of the great iceberg of consciousness.It’s this practice that ultimately allowed Slomo to overcome his assholeness and become happy. Truly happy.  Some might even say too happy for comfort — or at least polite company.15 years later Slomo is a Pacific Beach fixture. Most beachcombers likely assume he is some kind of crazy homeless guy with a mental disorder. Maybe a VA hospital cast away. But definitely a little nuts.In truth, Slomo is a revered treasure of this idyllic beach community. Communal property, protected and beloved by all who call this seaside enclave home.I like to think of Slomo as a boardwalk monk. A western version of the Hindi saddhus that inhabit the caves high in the Himalayas, deep in meditation. A now simple man practicing his spin (pun intended) on what it means to pursue a higher state of consciousness – or what some like to call enlightenment.Sound crazy? Maybe. But according to Slomo — and John Lennon — it’s everyone else that’s crazy.From lost in the rational world to the tip of the great iceberg of consciousness, it’s my honor and pleasure to bring you Slomo’s story. So let’s dive deep down this crazy rabbit hole and see where it leads.I hope you enjoy the listen.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

June 29, 2014

Today we’re back with some heavy nutrition talk!There is so much confusion out there about diet, food & optimal health. It’s enough to make even the most discerning, conscientious consumer’s head split wide open in frustration. Exasperated, we end up simply paralyzed — continuing to perpetuate unhealthy eating habits that enslave us to an inevitable future of disease, obesity and dependence upon the pharmaceutical industry.My humble opinion? Last week’s Time Magazine cover story on the comeback of butter doesn’t exactly help matters. Seriously?
To help set matters to rights and slice through the wide swath of confusion, obfuscation and downright misinformation, I am pleased to host the lovely and sagacious Sharon Palmer RD. For the uninitiated, “RD” stands for Registered Dietitian. But a more apropos professional acronym just might be “PPRD” – for PlantPowered Registered Dietitian.Sharon is the editor of the award-winning health newsletter Environmental Nutrition, and a nationally recognized nutrition expert who has personally impacted thousands of people’s lives through her writing and clinical work. She is the author of The Plant-Powered Diet: The Lifelong Eating Plan For Achieving Optimal Health, Starting Today*  and her new book Plant-Powered For Life: Eat Your Way to Lasting Health with 52 Simple Steps and 125 Delicious Recipes*  comes out on July 8 (available now for pre-order). These are books that empower everyone — whether vegan, vegetarian, or omnivorous — to put that Plantpower manifesto into practice by adopting a largely or entirely whole-foods, plant-based diet and thereby reaping such benefits as weight loss, optimal health, and longer life.Indeed, the Plantpower / Plant-Power meme isn’t just alive and well, it’s picking up steam.What’s great about Sharon is her easy-to-grasp, personal approach to food and diet, an approach that marshals the most up-to-date findings in nutrition to explain both why you should eat more plant-based fare and exactly how to do so.But more interesting that that (to me at least) is our dialog about transcending diet altogether. The idea that true wellness stems from adopting a more long-term, sustainable, holistic mind-body-spirit lifestyle approach to not only what you put in your mouth, but how you spend your time and actually live on a day-to-day basis.This is the approach that changed my life. The approach I do my best to embody daily. And the approach I continue to rely and fall back upon to keep my life balanced and in check (with varying degrees of success I might add). So it was great to hear Sharon echo this perspective.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.  If you do, tell a friend!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

June 23, 2014

Must be nice to have your life [sneer]……I wish I could…. [fill in the blank, with scorn]….but some people have to work for a living [biting sarcasm].The easy road is to resent those that have what you want. Or at least more of what you wish you had. Actually it’s more of a cop out than an easy road. But a cop out most of us take (usually unconsciously), which in turn leads to nothing good.Envy, anger, denial, self-loathing and defeatism are but a few of the common and predictable human emotions most likely to arise by default when confronted with that rare person living a fully actualized, aspirational life. A rewarding life where work and play are merged. A life that from the outside makes everything appear smooth, easy and obstacle free.You know the kind of guy I’m talking about right? Guys with names like Elon, Biz and LeBron. How annoying!I get it. But I also understand that annoyance is just a mild form of resentment. And resentment is an emotional luxury I personally can’t afford. Because it inevitably leads me to a place of deep suffering. Meanwhile, the object of my deep resentment remains blissfully unaware of my inner turmoil, continuing that envious life of authentic expression unperturbed and none the wiser. All the more maddening!So begins the downward shame spiral.Now let’s try a different tactic.  Instead of foisting negative energy outward upon this unassuming third person, let’s instead turn that powerful forefinger around — the one that loves to point and judge. Instead, let’s look within with honesty. Let’s accept where we are and invest in the plausibility of a positive new, forward moving trajectory. Let’s take action based on belief in your own personal potential and deservedness. And let’s embrace the process of unlocking and expressing your best, most authentic self to the fullest of your abilities.Yeah I know. Easier said than done.This is where today’s guest comes in. Not because he’s going to give you some version of “10 Steps To Live Your Dream Life” (for the record I can’t stand articles that involve numerical lists, but I digress).  But rather because sometimes a good old fashioned inspirational story well told is just about the most powerful thing imaginable when it comes to catalyzing positive change. A seismic shift in how we contemplate our lives, behave and interact with our environment and others that can lead us on new trajectories that permanently change our lives for the better.Daren Flitcroft
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again.  It’s fun to have well known people on the podcast. I know that I will get more downloads and rise up the iTunes charts when I host a celebrated guest with a huge following. That’s cool, but that’s not really what this mission is all about.The real joy is introducing you guys to someone you have never heard of.  Someone you might otherwise never encounter your entire life. From an uninformed perspective just an average person we can all relate to, navigating life on life’s terms. Struggling with the same things we all grapple with — finances, health, personal satisfaction, relationships, you name it.But someone I find special. And inspiring.Daren fits the bill.When he arrived at UCLA from Washington, D.C. in the fall of 2008 as a young scholarship athlete, everything seemed to be falling into place for Daren. Just another step closer in the unfoldment of his dream: becoming a professional soccer player.  But Daren’s vision ended abruptly when he suffered a career-ending injury. Adding insult to this injury? It occurred before he ever played a single college game.Most people would have crumbled. But instead of falling apart, resorting to anger, resentment and self-defeatism, Daren took stock of his life, channeled his latent ambition, and quickly set about pursuing a new dream.  A way to continue his love for soccer by pursuing a career in professional athlete representation. I’m not saying it was easy, but shortly after he graduated from UCLA, Daren fulfilled his dream by becoming a “young turk” sports agent at Wasserman Media Group  — one of the world’s most prestigious sports agencies.
Today Daren scours the country looking for emerging professional soccer talent.  And when he isn’t working, he’s running.  A veteran of many a marathon, Daren completed his first ultra earlier this month at The North Face 50 in Sterling, Virginia.We talk about it all.  College and professional soccer (oh so apropos given that we’re in the midst of World Cup right now), the agent’s perspective on what distinguishes a good athletic prospect from superstar potential, what it takes to identify, pursue and achieve your dreams, and how Daren rediscovered athletic satisfaction through running.Oh yeah, he’s also plant-based. Don’t think we don’t talk about that, because we totally do. And all sorts of other cool stuff too.In any event, Daren is a great guy with a compelling, inspirational message. One of the good guys.It was a pleasure getting to know him better and I am so happy to share his story with you.

June 16, 2014

You care about the planet, right?Of course you do. We’re all concerned about global climate change, melting ice caps, fracking, the pollution of our oceans and all the many more issues we currently face that threaten Earth’s long term sustainable health.As such, we do our best to be good planetary citizens. To keep our carbon footprint light, we eat local, recycle and compost. We opt for the bike and leave the hybrid car in the garage to reduce our fossil fuel dependance. We’ve swapped our lightbulbs for those new expensive ones that for whatever reason are supposed to be so much better. And here in California (and wherever we face drought) we limit our showers and curtail excess water usage.This is a very positive shift in consciousness. These are all great habits. So go ahead. It’s OK to feel good about yourself. In fact, give yourself a pat on the back for being awesome.But what if I told you that all of our individual good citizenship efforts are just the tiniest drop in the bucket when compared to the massively deleterious impact of just one particular industry most of us quite simply and unconsciously support on a daily basis every day of our lives?Whether we are talking about global climate change, the blindingly rapid destruction of our rain forests, over consumption of water, species extinction, the depletion and destruction of our soil, the pollution of our rivers, lakes and oceans or the obliteration of natural wildlife habitats, you might be surprised to discover the very inconvenient and uncomfortable truth that there is one industry single-handedly responsible for destroying and undermining the health and sustainability of our planet far more than any other.The elephant in the room – animal agriculture.It is indisputable that our global industrialized system of factory livestock harvesting is unsustainable. It’s killing us and it’s killing the planet. We must embrace this reality and work collectively to create new sustainable systems to feed the 7 billion people that walk the Earth.  Because the point of no return is quickly upon us.  We’re in the red. If we don’t promptly redirect, it truly will be too late.When it comes to conservation and ecological responsibility, the dialog generally focuses on fossil fuels. A big issue, of course; and worthy of our attention. But here’s a truth that all too often gets quietly swept under the rug: the deleterious environmental impacts of animal agriculture dwarf the impacts of fossil fuel demand in every single category across the board.So why aren’t we talking about it?This is the question explored by  Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret  — an incredibly sobering and powerful upcoming documentary that takes a hard, unflinching look at just why the issue of animal agriculture and its incomprehensibly negative impact fails to get the airtime it deserves in the global environmentalism conversation.  Imagine An Inconvenient Truth meets Blackfish and you get the picture.
Today on the podcast I am so excited to have the filmmakers here to tell us all about what is really going on — Keegan Kuhn and Kip Andersen.We truly are all connected on this small blue planet. And as such, no discussion about individual health in the micro is complete without conversation about global health in the macro. We have a collective responsibility to remove the blinders of denial, take the red pill from the Matrix, understand what is truly at play and marshall our planetary citizenship to catalyze the change this planet, our children and all its inhabitants deserve — before it’s too late.I sincerely hope this conversation challenges you and gives you something to really ponder.  And I encourage all of you to go out and see this film when it comes to a city near you.  And as always, let me know what you think in the comments section below.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

Imagine this: you are a practicing pediatric ER doctor; all day long every day you treat kids that are not just overweight, but obese.  More than obese, these kids are sick — really sick.What do you do?Well, you can do what most doctors do – tell the kids to ditch the salt, sugar and fat; swap the video games for some fresh air; maybe prescribe some medication for the cholesterol or blood pressure; then move on to the next patient. No time to linger….Or you can take a harder road. Despite a fellowship at Harvard Medical School, full time employment as an emergency room pediatrician, and editor of 3 medical textbooks, Dr. Sujit Sharma felt the need to do more. It was time to try something new: address the cause; focus on prevention; identify and provide doable, sustainable solutions that actually work.Radical!It was around this time that Dr. Sanjay Gupta— Sujit’s longtime University of Michigan buddy and yes, the guy from CNN — introduced Sujit to his friend Ladell Hill — a molecular health specialist, herbalist, fitness trainer and wellness expert who had been spent the last 20 years researching and experimenting with nutrition. A passion for healing Ladell inherited as legacy from his Native American grandfather.When he wasn’t training celebrities like Gwen Stefani & Lenny Kravitz, Ladell studied tirelessly for years to understand how to best apply the wisdom of his grandfather to his modern practice of health and wellness. He came to realize that science now substantiated much of what he learned from his grandfather: the power of an indigenous, whole food plant-based diet to not only promote overall well being and wellness optimization but to also expedite physiological recovery from exercise induced stress and even — in certain cases — prevent and reverse disease.Bold and powerful, particularly when you get a glimpse of Ladell, who at almost 50 sports jacked guns and the physique a 26 year old NFL running back would envy.Sujit and Ladell immediately hit it off. The result of their collaboration, combined expertise and passion is Chuice — a brand new category of food product that can only be explained as chewable juice.Chewable juice?!? Say what? Bizarre, right? I was skeptical. But I’ve tried it and it’s great – a mastication of nuts and seeds plus fruit and vegetable juice with all the fiber, every ingredient chosen for a specific cellular benefit — it’s like a delicious, super easily digestible whole food meal in a bottle.Disclaimer: This is not a paid endorsement or an advertisement of any kind. I have absolutely no business, financial, sponsorship, affiliate or other incentivized relationship with Chuice whatsoever. I just like these guys and find their mission worthy of discussion.A couple months ago, Sanjay introduced me to Sujit and Ladell simply because he thought we would hit it off. Out of courtesy to Sanjay, I ended up calling Sujit a couple days later thinking we would have a cordial few minutes on the phone.  Instead we spoke for almost two hours — dialoging on everything to wellness, to plant-based nutrition to the state of medicine and disease prevention. At at that moment I knew I needed to meet Ladell and have these guys on the show.They do not disappoint — a fascinating deep dive into the state of nutrition education in medical school; the ills of our current healthcare system; the potency and power of plants to prevent and heal disease; and a culminating call to action to return to the natural.I sincerely hope you enjoy the listen.Let me know what you think in the comments section below.

June 1, 2014

When I use the word “best” in reference to my guests, I mean it.Today’s guest truly earns the adjective.  If you follow the sport of competitive swimming, then this woman needs no introduction. Quite simply put, Rebecca Soni is one of the most accomplished athletes in the world, period. Here are just a few of her notables:In other words, don’t mess with Reb. But meet her on the street and you’d never know just how badass she is — her sweetNESS and genuine humility simply won’t allow it.If you know me, you know swimming is my first love. So anytime I get the chance to talk on the subject, it’s going to be long — sorry just can’t help it.  This conversation holds true, running at around 2 ½ hours. So I’m breaking the interview up into 2 parts.  Part 1 today (Sunday night — 6.1.14); Part 2 will post sometime Thursday — 6.5.14.Good stuff. A compelling journey through the the ups and downs of Rebecca’s unparalleled career, we dig deep into:“Legend” is a word that gets bandied about all too loosely these days.  But Rebecca more than earns the mantle and the respect the term truly deserves. She is a legend in the truest sense and her legacy in sport will more than stand the test of time.Plus, she’s super cool. After the show she hung out at our house with my kids and her dog Cody (you can hear him hanging around the pod in the background), let us play around with her gold medals and was basically just a delight.It was an honor to spend a few hours with her and couldn’t be more pleased to bring this conversation to you.  I sincerely hope you enjoy it!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

May 25, 2014

Today we delve into an entirely new world. The world of tea.I can hear you now: Tea?? Really? Why should I care about tea? I’ve been enjoying the podcast a lot lately, Rich.  But I’m not sure about this…I think you might have lost the thread this week. A couple years ago I would have probably said the same thing. I don’t feel that way anymore. So if you are thinking of skipping this episode because on the surface it doesn’t sound like something you are interested in, reconsider. Because — and as I always say — contempt prior to investigation imprisons one to everlasting ignorance.WuDe.Born in the United States as Aaron Daniel Fisher, Wude was drawn to the East from a very early age. After studying philosophy in college, he travelled the world and ultimately settled in Taiwan, where he has since become a Buddhist monk – steeped in the sutras and wisdom of that tradition – as well as a tea master – a vituoso of not just the living tradition of harvesting tea, but the living tradition of what tea means in a sort of meta sense – why it’s important and why we should care about it.Tea as medicine. Tea as healing. Tea as life.Tea Practice as Zen.The easiest way to put it is that WuDe comes from this idea that tea is a universal living, breathing thing that unifies us all — the tree of life.Think of tea as a metaphor. A foundational concept around which to structure a set of ancient teachings, principles, knowledge and wisdom to glean a broader truth about health, healing, community, the environment, life, life’s meaning and the unifying oneness – or undeniable interconnectedness of everythingIn Taiwan WuDe founded and runs Global Tea Hut— a school and center devoted to the education and preservation of the ancient tradition of harvesting living tea and welcomes people from all over the world to come study and practice tea preparation, meditation, tea history, tea crafting, the sutras of tea and its relevance in society, and how to cultivate the Dao of Tea as a method of spiritual expansion.I realize today’s guest and these topics may be slightly off your personal reservation. That’s cool – it was for me initially as well. All I ask is that you set aside whatever preconceived notions you may be harboring and enter this episode with an open mind. Do that, and I assure you will come out the other side with not only a new and informed view on the import of tea, but a greater understanding of Zen. An expanded perspective on consciousness. And a heightened awareness of the oneness that unites us all.WuDe spills over with crazy mad wisdom that more than merits your attention and contemplation.I promise this just might be the most fascinating conversation you will hear all week.I sincerely hope you enjoy the show.  Let me know what you think in the comments below!Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

May 19, 2014

People say people don’t change.Bullshit.I have the great honor of seeing and participating in lives that have changed so dramatically the people they are today bear almost no resemblance to who they once were.Weight loss, sure – I see that all the time. I’m talking more about drastic career changes; dramatic spiritual awakenings; and impossible recovery from profound addictions. I’m talking about people who change from that person you’d shuffle across the street to avoid – literal mental insanity – to becoming inspirational leaders among men. Alterations so stunning I’m left awestruck; and with a profound sense that there must be powers at work beyond the mere mortal.If this show is anything, it’s an effort to share those stories to inspire that kind of hope, aspiration and possibility in you. That no matter what your circumstance or plight in life, that transcending the obstacles you face is within reach.When I recorded the introduction to this episode and wrote down these thoughts, it was 3:30 am. Jetlagged and wide awake, I just returned from a whirlwind trip across the globe – 3 weeks on the road in Canada, Beirut, Lebanon and all across Saudi Arabia. Riyadh in the heart of the Arabian desert, Al Khobar on the Persian Gulf & Jeddah on the Red Sea.  If you follow me on Instagram or Facebook you might have seem some pictures of me running in all those places. Apologies for all the selfies, but I just wanted to share what I was experiencing with everyone. It was such a fantastic journey and privilege to see parts of the world I never in a million years thought I would ever have the opportunity to see.I gave 6 talks over the course of the trip; all in their own right amazing. Particularly in the Middle East, where the cultural divide can seem so profound and impenetrable that making a true connection seemed almost impossible.And yet to connect with people on a fundamental level over things and concerns we all share no matter what the dictates of our cultural prerogatives – our health, the health of our children, nutrition, prevention of disease, fitness and the ills of our food system ecosystem – was life altering for me. I know it made it impact on them as well.It feels really good. An experience I am immensely grateful for. An experience I won’t soon forget.My point is that I have changed. Dramatically and irrevocably. Mostly in ways I didn’t expect. Could never have predicted. And certainly never dreamed, consciously plotted or specifically devised. But definitely in ways I embrace and love.For most of my life, all I wanted was to be someone else. And now I can say that I would not trade my life for anyone.It all started when I made a decision to do the inside work. As I got healthier — physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually — I learned, very slowly and stubbornly I might add, how to lean into, trust and take action on my (once dubious and self-will driven) instincts, no matter how illogical or contrary to my chosen life path they may have seemed at the time.This has made all the difference.  It is the reason I enjoy the life I have today.It begins with mining your personal truth. And then embarking on the journey of living it. Something I want everyone to experience — and why I do this show.If today’s guest is anything, he is a guy who is living his truth. Living his own unique brand of passion. Walking a road less traveled, and inspiring people the world over.Timothy Shieff.Otherwise known as Livewire, Timothy is widely considered one of the world’s best (if not the best) Freerunners. More commonly referred to as parkour (although I have since discovered there is a difference), Timothy specializes in doing the kind of thing you see in the Jason Bourne and James Bond movies — running up walls, jumping off roofs and generally defying gravity and the laws of physics with nothing but incredible skill, laser sharp coordination, impossible body strength, and the mere momentum of his body.This is a long way of saying that this proper and polite young English lad can do things you can’t. Mind-bending, mind-blowing body movements that have made him a superstar in his chosen subculture and beyond.But quite honestly, Timothy’s athletic skill — and his interesting relationship with fear that allows him to place himself in situations most wouldn’t dare — is secondary to his indefatigable drive to inspire others the world over towards self betterment through the incredible transformative power of body movement.Additionally passionate about the planet, Timothy’s discipline can be described as a form of physical, quasi-political performance art – a demonstration of how we can live more in harmony with nature and our immediate surroundings. A reframing of what a building, rooftop, curb or staircase railing actually means by inverting and expanding upon the possibilities in which a human being can interact with it.On top of all of this, Timothy is 100% plant-based. An ardent vegan and close friend & cohort of Jamie Oliver, Tim shares his many opinions on the subject, which just might make you rethink a few traditional assumptions about the relationship between nutrition and extraordinary athletic performance. Particularly as it relates to an athlete of his kind, where explosiveness, power, speed, incredible body strength and precise coordination dictate everything. And draw the line between astounding feats and mortal injury.But more than any of this, it’s Tim’s spirit that moves me, and why I’m so proud to have him on today’s show.The first line of his website bio says it all:  I’m a Human practicing Being. His stunning high-gloss music video-esque 2014 Showreel says the rest – it’s an absolute show stopper:In any event, I found out Tim was visiting Los Angeles from his native UK when my buddy Mac Danzig (MMA/UFC fighter who guested in RRP #45 ) texted me and said I had to meet Tim.  I was super busy at the time and didn’t think I would be able to make it work. Then the next day I ran into my Ninja Warrior buddy Travis Brewer (also a former guest on RRP #70 ) who told me he had been training with Tim that day.The universe was making it clear – I had to meet this guy.So I made the time. I’m so glad I did.Travis also sits down with us to co-host today and we dug in. Here’s Tim jumping across my roof before we sat down for the chat.  Unbelievable.I genuinely hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

Unless you are a new listener to the show, then you very well may be fatigued by my show opening mantra.  If so, you’re out of luck, because I’m going to repeat it here anyway:Each week I bring you the best most forward thinking, paradigm busting minds in health, fitness, athleticism, creativity, diet, nutrition, art, entrepreneurship, personal growth & spirituality….The goal is simple: to empower YOU with the tools, the knowledge, the inspiration and motivation to take your life to the next level. To help you discover, unlock and unleash your BEST most AUTHENTIC self.I repeat it here because it’s particularly relevant to today’s guest and topic.I repeat it here because I need to remind myself that in order to make that leap to so unlock and unleash, I must say yes to experiences outside my comfort zone.  I must be and remain open to new ideas that are unfamiliar. I must continue to be willing to risk.  And I must be willing to experience things that still scare me.There is a truism I find myself repeating under my breath: you cannot transmit something you haven’t got.In other words, if I hope to so transmit, by way of this podcast, the inspiration and tools I profess to offer, then I must walk that talk. Otherwise I strike a false chord – my words become inauthentic. And this house I bled to build becomes a mere house of cards, soon to fall in upon itself.After a rewarding 7 days in Ontario with Julie, I’m now traveling alone — in the midst of this extraordinary speaking tour across the Middle East — Beirut, Lebanon and three cities across Saudi Arabia: Riyadh, Jeddah and Al Khobar.Traveling to this part of the world intimidates me. Is it safe? Can I go outside and run without negative repercussion? And how will I and my message be received by cultures so different from my own?I love traveling. I can think of few things that excite me more than getting on a plane for a very long flight to some exotic place I have never before seen.  And yet, I am definitely well outside my comfort zone. These are not places that I would ordinarily choose to visit. But that’s what makes it so enthralling. I am wide open to the multitude of opportunities they potentially offer.It’s about practicing “yes” to the new experiences that present themselves, irrespective of whatever feelings of fear, insecurity, doubt and anxiety that creep up and strive to keep my life small for the sake of comfort and security — emotions I know are underpinned by illusion – what the Hindus call Maya.For me, the practice of saying yes in the face of such fear and doubt has been paying dividends of late.I can’t tell you what an incredible experience Beirut has been the last few days. A place in so many ways vastly different from what I expected. Imagine a mashup of old and new. Cote D’Azur meets Arabia. Parts almost indistinguishable from Milan or Paris or Tuscany – très chic European, sophisticated and urban teeming with beautiful, intelligent, curious people I had the privilege of spending time with. There’s a reason it’s called The Paris of the Middle East.But turn your head to peer behind my lovely hotel on the waterfront and you will see the unmistakable scars of war. The scaffold of the towering old Holiday Inn hotel – once the pride and pearl of the city — looms high yet decimated and rife with bullet indentations and gaping holes from shell fire artillery blasts. Demolished just after construction was completed when the civil war broke out on 1975, the scaffold still stands in a state of utter disreapir as a constant reminder of a different time, and the ever-present instability that underpins the city’s elegant, cosmopolitan veneer.As I sit here tonight finishing up this post, I am now writing from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. More on this city in a later post, but for now I will just say that I spent an evening in a beautiful private home delivering my message to a small group of 15 Saudi businessmen dressed in traditional thobe attire, some accompanied by their wives. The cultural divide at first struck me as almost impenetrable. I am not well versed in the cultural etiquette. I don’t know the rules here! Can I address the women or must I not make eye contact? Will I offend them with my message? There is no way these people are going to be even the slightest bit interested in what I have to offer.For a moment I was terrified. I have never before felt further from home — and I’ve been to Pakistan! Then I closed my eyes. Took a breath. Consciously surrendered to the moment. Asked to be simply a channel for service.  Nothing more, nothing less. And then let it all go.Relief.Now in the moment, the cultural divide vanished. And by the end of the evening, I felt completely at home — because I was.It was an incredible experience.  And one I will not soon forget.As I sit here tonight, I am in touch with the miraculous and impossibly beautiful turns my life has taken.How did this happen? By learning how to say yes — not just to opportunities that once would have scared me, but to myself — my higher self. To the inner, instinctual voice I have — through years of inside work — come to trust as my ultimate life navigator.  Because the voice does not divine from what I think of as me, but from something higher.  What Julie would call Divine Consciousness.How did this happen? By choosing above all — to echo a mantra evoked by filmmaker Casey Neistat in a previous episode to invest in experience.Reflecting on all of this, I am enriched — for these experiences have made me better, broader, more expanded and compassionate.But most of all, I am grateful.Gratitude.It’s been a while, but Julie is now back in the copilot seat for today’s show, and gratitude is the subject of the hour.This is a good one people. Be open. Choose to invest in this experience. And say yes to receiving information that might be new to you.And stick around through the end — you won’t want to miss Julie’s beautiful rendition of her song Cry.I hope you enjoy the offering.SHOW NOTESLegal Zoom: Use Referral Code RICH at Checkout:  http://www.legalzoom.comHOW CAN I SUPPORT THE PODCAST?1.

May 8, 2014

Today were back with Ultraman competitor and EPIC5 finisher Christian Isakson for Part 2 of our conversation.Thanks for all the great comments and feedback I received on social media this week in response to Part 1. If you haven’t listened to that one yet dial it up first before tuning in herePart 2 just gets better. We delve into Christian’s racing. He walks us through his first-hand experience completing EPIC5 and what it took to put his imprimatur on last year’s Ultraman World Championships.Then we turn to service. Christian’s commitment to giving back through his involvement with Chris Lieto’s non-profit More Than Sport and and his recent work in Kenya with Ameena Project.  And how faith, family and humility are keystones to remain grounded, focused and on point.The message is this — if you want your life to have true meaning, satisfaction, fulfillment and a legacy of value, giving back in a meaningful way is essential.If you are feeling adrift, Christian’s message will help right your ship. If he has inspired you to seek out a more fulfilling path for yourself but you’re just not sure how to embark on your own version of his story, then — as mentioned in the introduction to this episode — you might be encouraged by my new online course on MindBodyGreen.com entitled The Art of Living With Purpose– 2+ hours of streaming video content with an array of downloadable tools I learned, honed and devised to course correct my life — tools I continue to rely on to this day to keep my life focused and on track. Give it a look if it feels right to you.I hope you enjoy Part 2 as much as Part 1.

May 5, 2014

Today’s guest is a guy I relate to on so many levels. Like a big Venn diagram of overlapping circles — ultra-endurance multi-sport athlete, dad, husband, Ultraman competitor and EPIC5 finisher.Today’s guest is unique in that he is the only guy I have ever had on the show who, like me, has competed in both the Ultraman World Championships and EPIC5 (not that there are very many of us – I think only a few).Today’s guest is also unique for his strong sense of faith, directed purpose and commitment to giving back in service to others the blessings bestowed upon him.Today’s guest is Christian Isakson.Christian and I first connected online several years ago on the eve of his 2011 attempt on EPIC5 (one year after I completed that challenge). Christian absolutely rocked it, completing the distance within the five day period I strived for, yet fell short. In the wake of that effort, I vividly recall several conversations in which I encouraged him to ply his trade at Ultraman. Ironically, Christian was unsure — at the time not yet wholly confident in his abilities despite the potential I clearly saw in him. Yet he obliged. To be clear, not because of me – I just gave him a nudge. And at this past year’s World Championship in Hawaii, he proved his mettle and then some. His race was far from perfect, but Christian more than distinguished himself as a future contender for the top podium spot, putting his imprimatur on the race with a stunning Day 2 bike effort that had him leading the field for the majority of the brutal 170-mile day.Since our first Facebook exchange, Christian and I have been e-mail pen pals and phone buddies — corresponding consistently over the years about everything from balancing parenting & marriage to nutrition, training strategies, racing, the role of faith and most importantly service — how best to give this whole ultra-endurance experience greater meaning for others beyond mere race results.And yet Christian and I had never actually met in person. But no matter — from our first conversation we have been close; meeting in person existing as nothing more than a formality. All that changed a few weeks ago when Christian came down to Los Angeles for a short overnight visit with me and my family. The hug he gave me when I picked him up at the airport just made our brotherhood official.Today we sit down and sift through it all – the pain, passion, love and faith that fuels and drives him. The unique push-pull allure of ultra-distance racing. And how he balances this brutally demanding lifestyle to maintain a healthy and happy marriage, great relationship with his kids, and a rewarding career as a paramedic / firefighter.But what makes Christian really tick is his faith. His fidelity to his church. And how service plays into his success equation – from his endeavors with various church organizations to his involvement with Chris Lieto’s  non-profit  More Than Sport  and Ameena Project – an NGO which took him to Kenya recently to provide much needed medical care to underprivileged in urgent need.I can attest to the fact that Christian returned from Kenya a changed man. A better, more focused man with a keener sense of priorities. His short documentary on the experience tells the tale:In all honesty, it’s rare that I get an opportunity to sit down with a guy with whom I share so many things in common. As a result, this conversation is long. Really long.  3 hours long.  So I decided to try something new.  For the first time in the brief history of the RRP, I’m splitting this episode up into two parts to be released in the same week. Part 2 will go up later this week on Thursday, May 8.There are so many fascinating aspects to Christian’s story. I don’t want to spoil it, so you will just have to listen.But I will say this: Christian is a solid guy. One of the good guys. The guy you root for and really want to see succeed. Because he shoots straight and walks his talk. Shows up when he says he’s going to show up and always gives 110% without any expectation of what he might receive in return. A guy with a really strong moral compass and sense of direction. One of those guys whose handshake means more than any signed contract. Old School. Almost as if he comes from an older generation when things like that actually meant something.My point is this: it is truly rare to find a friend of such solid stock, sturdy moral fiber and unperturbedly strong sense of who he is.  Christian is one of those guys.It’s my honor to know this man. To be his friend. And to share this conversation with you today.I sincerely hope you enjoy it.PS – I just e-mailed Christian to let him know the interview went live. He reminded me of the auspiciousness of this date of publication — May 5 is the day we both took the first step on our respective EPIC5 journeys.  In all honesty it never occurred to me until he mentioned it.  Crazy how the Universe works sometimes.  But the longer I walk this path the more weird stuff like this just seems to happen.SHOW NOTESConnect With Christian Isakson:  Website  |  Facebook  |  Twitter  |  InstagramHOW CAN I SUPPORT THE PODCAST?1.

So many things wrong in the world.Melting ice caps. Greenhouse gas emissions. Global climate change. GMO Frankenfoods. Depleted soils. Poisoned fish. Rampant childhood obesity. Unsustainable food systems. Horrifying school lunch programs. Unprecedented hurricanes. Insane tsunamis. Constant forest fires. And oh yeah – how about that Texas-sized flotilla of plasticized garbage goo floating out in the Pacific somewhere?I could go on like this all day.  We all could.  Because in truth it’s easy to identify — and become despondent (if not just altogether passive and nonplussed) about the state of the planet, the environment, our citizenship and basic humanity when you take an honest look at the havoc we have wrecked upon ourselves.F-it.

Humanitarian. 24 years old.Suddenly, all that despondency is replaced with hope – optimism for the future of the planet and humanity courtesy of the next generation.I had never heard of Kyle until a buddy of mine posted an image on Instagram a few months back that promoted Kyle’s latest short film: Pro Surfers vs. GMO’s :I immediately clicked to watch and was honestly moved. Sure, the film is informative and inspiring. But beyond the content, I was genuinely impressed to find such a young guy so passionate about our food system. Digging deeper I realized this doc was nothing new for this Santa Cruz kid, who was raised by documentary filmmaker parents and has been putting out short films on global health and environmental issues for years via Surfing For Change  — Kyle’s online YouTube series merging surf imagery & lifestyle with current global issues with focus on the power of individuals to create a better world through everyday decisions.Kyle’s impact has already been substantial. Beyond speaking gigs at universities across the US and features in publications like  Outside Magazine  and  Surfer Magazine, one of Kyle’s first film projects took a look at global bank funding and suggested that people divest from the Bank of Americas of the world and instead invest in local communities  and credit unions. As a direct result of this specific project, Surfing for Change tracked over $110 million of lending power moving out of centralized banks and into local communities. That is serious impact. That is awesome.If that’s not enough, Kyle gets extra cool points for being the only person I am aware of to ever deliver a TED Talk without a shirt on. That takes cajones.Be honest: if you were a handsome pro surfer in your early 20’s whose job was to travel the world in search of the tastiest waves, how much time do you think you would spend on trying to make a difference in the world?Kyle doesn’t have to do what he does. The fact that he chooses of his own volition to invest himself in serving a higher purpose makes his message all the more powerful and resonant.The millennial generation gets a ton of flack for allegedly being entitled and narcissistic. But Kyle upends this presumption as misplaced, if not altogether false. My experience — as both a father of two millennial teenage boys and as someone who spends quite a bit of time with people far younger than myself — is that there are countless young people out there a lot like Kyle. Energetic young people committed to service, improving the planet and making a difference in a way I never saw in myself or my peers when I was of that age.Let Kyle light the way and be an example of what can be done when passion and faith meet a service mindset and tireless commitment to blaze a new path to better the small world we share.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.SHOW NOTESHOW CAN I SUPPORT THE PODCAST?1.

477,Spoken Word Artist IN-Q,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-81-spoken-word-poet-in-q-on-reimagining-your-truth/,"Episode 81
April 21, 2014

The past couple weeks we went deep into nutrition. Now it’s time to take a new direction. To delve into spirit. Creativity. And art. All powerful vehicles for connecting with, unlocking and ultimately expressing the authentic truth of who you are — the crux of life transformation.Today we Reimagine Your Truth.Today we meet IN-Q.Rapper. Actor. Teacher. Songwriter & internationally revered spoken word artist.Wait a minute — what?? A poet? How could spoken word, rap music and this guy possibly have anything to do with the themes of this show?I can read your mind. I get it. But I ask you to please reserve whatever preconceived ideas or opinions you may have about what’s to come. Because ignorance is contempt prior to investigation. I promise you this — after this interview you won’t be asking yourself that question.I first met IN-Q up at a thing called Summit Series  — an organization that began in 2008 with a small group of young entrepreneurs harboring a giant collective dream to change the world. Led by an enterprising young man named Eliot Bisnow (who coincidentally went to my high school), Summit began as an annual four-day events for 1,000 of the world’s leading entrepreneurs, nonprofit leaders, artists, scientists, athletes, and change makers with the intention of driving positive growth and collaboration.The events were extremely successful. But Summit has since evolved far beyond a mere producer of TED-like events. Today, it stands tall as a truly unique community of compelling thought leaders who truly are changing the world. About a year ago, the Summit organization took up permanent residence in Eden, Utah — a quiet hamlet north of Salt Lake nestled in the Wasatch Mountains — when they purchased a mountain. That’s right: an entire mountain & functioning ski resort called Powder Mountain. Not just any ski resort, “PowMow” is in fact the largest ski mountain in the entire United States.Ambitious? It’s just the beginning. Summit’s goal is to unite thought leaders and innovators of today and tomorrow by over time growing this now small community into an international epicenter of culture and innovation across all disciplines of art, music, technology, entertainment, science, literature, social entrepreneurism and education.Eliot invited Julie and I up to Powder Mountain this past winter to speak and simply enjoy a weekend getting to know Summit.  Honestly, I didn’t know what to expect.  I had known the Summit crew for a couple years – in fact Julie taught them a yoga class back in 2008 when it was just a small group of people with big dreams cohabitating in a house in Malibu — but had yet to experience it for myself.I have to say it was a transformative experience. I left completely inspired.One of the most compelling people we met was none other than today’s guest — IN-Q.I’ll be upfront. I’m not a poetry guy. I’m not a hip hop guy. These are foreign worlds I know very little to nothing about. On the surface, IN-Q is therefore an unlikely choice for the podcast. But I was so impressed with this man. The moment I met him I knew instantly that I had to have him on the show.Before each group dinner up at Summit, IN-Q would deliver a poem – a true demonstration of performance art to set the energy of the evening.  More prayer than poem. More inspirational panegyric than prayer even. I simply had never heard anything like it before. It was completely unique.But it’s not just IN-Q’s mad skills that left my jaw agape.  To be sure, he is oozing with talent and displays total command over his instrument and art. It was his spirit that truly moved me. The way he conducts himself with complete integrity, gratitude and grace; with a rare openness and palpable, unguarded honesty. And the positive resonating message he chooses to convey through his art, writing and voice. IN-Q is a special, special guy.  One of those people who is touched in a very real, tactile way.To paint the picture a bit, IN-Q is a national poetry slam champion who has shared the stage with Barack Obama, De La Soul, Eminem, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, John Legend and is the first poet to ever share a stage with Cirque de Soleil. He has toured over 70 colleges with his one man show; written songs for Miley Cyrus & Rock Mafia; co-wrote Selena Gomez’s hit song “Love You Like a Love Song”; and has been featured on HBO’s Def Poetry Jam, Versus & Flow, Discovery Channel, Disney Channel. Nickelodeon, EA Sports, ABC, NBC, and A&E.I won’t give away his story – that’s what the podcast is for.  But I will say it’s a story you won’t want to miss. A story and a message that will no doubt make a powerful impression on you. Not only will it move and inspire you, it will help you reframe your perception on your own life.Let IN-Q help you reimagine YOUR truth.I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.PS – here is one of my favorite IN-Q jams:SHOW NOTESHOW CAN I SUPPORT THE PODCAST?1.

478,"Howard Jacobson, PhD",https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-80-howard-jacobson-on-rethinking-the-science-of-nutrition/,"Episode 80
April 14, 2014

Wow! Last week’s guest, T. Colin Campbell, got a huge response. It’s only a week since publication and the episode is well on its way to becoming one of the most popular editions of the RRP to date. Glad you enjoyed it and — as always — thanks for tuning in.Because the Dr. Campbell conversation introduced a large new population to the show, thought I would take a brief moment to clarify what we do here. You may think this is just another podcast focused on running & triathlon. I love those subjects and feature plenty of guests in those arenas. But my focus is broader.In short, each week I do my best to bring to you the most forward thinking, paradigm busting minds in health, fitness, wellness, diet, nutrition, spirituality, creativity, entrepreneurship and life transformation.My goal is pure and it is simple. To help motivate and inspire you take your life to the next level. To help you discover, unlock and unleash your best, most authentic self.  BOOM. If you have yet to check out last week’s episode, I urge everyone to give that one a listen before checking out today’s show. Even if you think you know all there is to know about T. Colin Campbell, his research, The China Study* and the quote unquote alleged “controversy” surrounding the findings of this seminal work, you might be surprised. Dr. Campbell demonstrated tremendous candor. It was an honor to peek behind the curtain at a life well lived in service to the betterment of humankind.In any event, last week’s guest relates directly to today’s guest. As I mentioned last week, Dr. Campbell was intended as Part 1 of a 2-part series.What began with Dr. Campbell continues today with Howard Jacobson, Dr. Campbell’s contributing author on his latest book Whole: Rethinking The Science of Nutrition* – a book that picks up where  The China Study*  left off by addressing the inherent flaws in our “reductionist” approach to nutrition research and refocusing how we approach and begin to understand nutrition and it’s impact on human physiology from a wholistic point of view – food functionality at the cellular level, working its way up to how it impacts the entire organism.Great.  But who is Howard Jacobson?Well, Howard’s background isn’t quite what you would think. He’s not a doctor. He’s not a nutritionist. physiologist or even a scientist. But he is a very smart guy. After getting his B.A. from Princeton, Howard began his career as a school teacher before becoming a successful marketing consultant, running an online marketing agency and writing the book  Google AdWords for Dummies*  (mental note: I should probably read this one).But how does a “marketing guy” end up hooking up with one of the world’s leading minds in health sciences and ultimately become contributing author on such a seminal work on nutrition?I had the same question on my mind. You’ll have to wait for the interview to hear the answer. But I can tell you it’s a very compelling story – the story of a life journey in search of greater meaning and greater authenticity. A story of faith, serendipity and what can happen when you take the leap into the unknown. Set sail without a paddle. And remain open to the possibilities the universe presents — the idea that truly anything is possible.We do it all – starting and ending of course with plant-based nutrition, and the central role it has played in his life, and that of his family. Howard shares his perspective on Dr. Campbell’s work. He picks up where Dr. C left off on the so-called China Study “debunkers”. And we discuss the crux of Whole — in particular our reductionist proclivities when it comes to nutritional science and how we must reframe how we think about food and how it impacts the body if we want true understanding.Because our current health system and practices are unsustainable, the public has more power of influence than ever before. Change is finally within our reach. We now know that most heart attacks and strokes, cancers and unnecessary deaths are preventable through nutrition, and we can choose wisely what we put into our mouths every day. This conversation with Howard will help you see Whole as an extraordinary tool to show us how to free our bodies, our minds, and our planet from the economic disparity and biological logic that is making us sicker and poorer than ever before.As an aside, over the last few years I had met Howie a few times at various events and conferences, but I hadn’t really spent enough time with him to understand the trajectory.  It wasn’t until the recent Holistic Holiday at Sea that my family and I had the opportunity to spend quality time with him, his wife and his two amazing children. Together they are an extraordinary family unit doing amazing things. So it is my pleasure and honor to bring this conversation to you today.Let’s dig in.PS – we recorded this on a huge boat. Huge. You will hear the gurgling. The anchor rearing up. The engine. Tyler did his best to optimize the audio, but it it is what it is. Not much I can do about that, so let’s live with it with a grateful smile on our faces.SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

April 7, 2014

This week we hit a huge milestone – 2 MILLION DOWNLOADS! Wow. I was blown away when we hit 1 million after about a year since we started this experiment. Then just five months later, we hit the second million. I am beyond words. I love doing the podcast, love it. I do this for you. So it means more than you can imagine that it has found a passionate and loyal audience. With utmost sincerity, I thank you from the bottom of my heart and promise to honor your commitment to the show by striving to always do better and be better.In honor of the milestone, I thought it appropriate to bring you one of my most compelling and important interviews to date. A conversation with a man I owe my life. A man whose studies, books and tireless advocacy have transformed countless lives across the globe. A man absolutely instrumental in paving a path for my own personal transformation — a journey that begins and ends with my adoption of a plant-based diet.T. Colin Campbell
Dr. Campbell may not have invented the whole food plant-based diet, but he is most certainly the regal lion of the movement, pioneering it from fringe acceptance to modern age, widespread mainstream adoption. He is best-known as the author of The China Study*, one of the most important, ground-breaking, massively best-selling books ever written on health & nutrition. More recently, Dr. Campbell published an important follow up, Whole: Rethinking The Science of Nutrition*. But even if you have not read either of these books, there is a solid chance you saw him and his work profiled in the incredibly powerful documentary Forks Over Knives*. The simple truth is that how we are beginning to understand the ways in which food and nutrition impact the underlying causes of so many Western diseases that unnecessarily plague developed cultures — and the means to prevent and reverse them — is due in large part to the tireless scientific research to which Dr. Campbell has devoted his life. He is, quite simply put, an absolute paradigm-busting legend of the modern movement for long-term wellness, disease prevention & reversal, sustainable ecosystems, animal welfare, and agricultural reform.For the uninitiated, T. Colin Campbell is a Cornell and MIT trained Ph.D. in nutrition, biochemistry and microbiology and current professor emeritus at Cornell specializing in both nutrition & toxicology – specifically the effects of nutrition on long-term health and even more particularly the role nutrition plays in the causation of certain types of cancer. In addition to the two books mentioned above, he is the author of over 300 peer reviewed research papers on a variety of subjects related to the above.Maybe you’re new to all this — I don’t get all the fuss. What exactly is The China Study?In a nutshell, it was a gigantic 20-year epidemiological study – described by The New York Times as “the Grand Prix of epidemiology” – conducted by the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, Cornell and Oxford that looked at mortality rates from cancer and other chronic diseases from 1973–75 in 65 counties in China; the data was correlated with dietary surveys and blood work from 100 people in each county.Why China? And why those specific counties? These communities were carefully selected primarily because they had genetically similar populations that tended, over many generations, to live and eat in the same way in the same place.What were the findings? The study concluded that counties with a high consumption of animal-based foods were more likely to have had higher death rates from “Western” diseases while the opposite was true for counties that ate more plant foods.In essence, The China Study* examined the relationship between the consumption of animal products (including dairy) and chronic illnesses such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancers of the breast, prostate and bowel, concluding that people who eat a whole-food, plant-based/vegan diet—avoiding all animal products, including beef, pork, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese and milk, and reducing their intake of processed foods and refined carbohydrates — will escape, reduce or even reverse the development of numerous diseases.Much to Dr. Campbell’s surprise, the book barely moved the needle when it was first published. In fact, it basically landed with a thud. But slowly, things started to take off when certain highly influential people began to discover the book, implement it’s advice, and experience dramatic positive results in their health and waistline.Even President Bill Clinton became a vocal supporter. After years of living with heart disease, in 2010 he undertook the diet, and within a short period dropped 24 pounds, returning him to his college weight. You might have seen my buddy Sanjay Gupta, CNN’s chief medical correspondent, interview Clinton for Dr. Gupta’s documentary The Last Heart Attack that aired on CNN in August 2011.  In that documentary, Dr Gupta made evident the power of plants — and the impact of Dr. Campbell’s dietary guidelines — on not only slimming the gut, but in preventing and even reversing heart disease. A protocol that has seen similar results in the prevention and reversal of obesity, diabetes and certain forms of cancer — 4 diseases that currently gobble up 75% of America’s total health care costs.Pretty awesome stuff.But The China Study is not without its critics and controversy. In the wake of the massive success of his book and Forks Over Knives*, his findings have been challenged — correlation does not equal causation! And suddenly — for reasons that essentially elude me — it has become quite vogue to offhandedly and rather thoughtlessly quip: Didn’t you hear the news? The China Study was debunked!But has The China Study really been debunked? What is this truly all about?Ask yourself this question: Who is threatened by attempting to undermine the integrity of Dr. Campbell’s game changing research?  And who stands to gain?We get in to all of this and so much more in today’s conversation.Dr. Campbell does not often sit for such long-winded interviews, so it was quite an honor and privilege to grab an hour of his time during the recent Holistic Holiday at Sea.  I had met him on several occasions over the last few years, but this was my first opportunity really getting to know the person behind the book, the research, and the movement. And I learned a lot.I am very proud of this interview and hope that it will inspire and motivate you to think about your health, your diet and your lifestyle in new and different ways — ways that could have a profound impact on your future well-being. And even if you are well versed with Dr. Campbell and his work, I promise you will learn things about him, his life and research that you did not previously know.A final note: this interview is intended as Part 1 of a 2 part series. Next week, I will be bringing you Howard Jacobson, Ph.D.— Dr. Campbell’s contributing author on Whole – who shares his own compelling story and fills in the gaps on some of the issues touched upon during today’s conversation. So if you enjoy today’s show you will definitely want to tune in next week as well.In any event, I truly hope today’s conversation educates and inspires you to take your nutrition, health and fitness to the next level. All as a means to help you unlock and unleash your best, most authentic self.Thanks for tuning in.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

March 31, 2014

I had to put my dog down the other day. I want to tell you about it. It might seem unrelated to introducing today’s podcast guest, but it’s not. So bear with me.Bodhi was a great dog. Indeed, a prince. But over the last several months, cancer took the upper hand. Tumors filled his left lung until it shut down, diseased cells metastasizing at a horrible pace until the poor guy could barely lift his head, let alone stand up. Stalwart, Bodhi hid his pain well. But it was there; unmistakable and unrelenting. I felt helpless.  
It’s the humane thing to do. You did the right thing.The words of the kind veterinarian who handled the Kevorkian end of this pyrrhic victory to cease my dog’s suffering.I gently cradled his head and locked my eyes with his as the needle sank deep beneath his fur. What followed were my tears as the fragile life force dwindled from his limp body until his beautiful soul had vanished altogether. All the while, my only thought: this doesn’t feel like the right thing. In fact, it all feels terribly, horribly wrong.Bodhi is gone.It happens. The heartache that accompanies the short lifespan of man’s best friend is the very nature of this relationship. I signed up for it and I accept it. In truth, our golden retriever had a great 12 years with our family – a time we will always cherish and for which I am forever grateful. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt.  In truth, it sucks.Bodhi is short for Bodhisattva – the ancient Sanskrit word for enlightened being. One who is motivated by great compassion. A more apt name for this dog does not, could not, exist.I guess the point is, as incredibly trite as this may sound – and it is nothing if not trite – life is short. Life is precious. Life is fleeting. And if one lives life motivated by fear and locked into habits that lead to regression, safety and misery, the precipitous end to that life will be nothing if not a lament to regret and remorse –for the authentic life of the higher self left unlived.We live in our flawed memories of the past. And are experts at projecting outcomes and fantasies onto a future that simply does not (and unlikely will ever) exist. What we rarely do is live in the now. Present in the moment. Experiencing gratitude for the immediacy of what is happening right in front of our very eyes on a second-to-second basis.Why is this so hard for us humans?The answer to this question brings me to today’s guest.Timothy Olson.A man who understands and appreciates what it means to fully embrace the present. To live his life in the throes of gratitude. Yes, he runs. Faster, further and wider than most anyone else on Earth. But it’s this aforementioned spiritual perspective and journey that defines what this guy — at his core — is truly all about.For the uninitiated, Timothy is an insanely accomplished world reknown ultrarunner. Aside from Kílian Jornet (who we can almost write off as otherworldly), you could make the argument that Timothy is one of the greatest — if not the greatest — ultrarunners on the planet right now.After pulling himself out of a drug-fueled descent into the dark abyss — a journey that left him lost in life, depressed, desperate, incarcerated and on probation — Timothy found not just solace but an entirely new life through running. A path that unfolded a fundamental personal spirituality emanating from hours alone exploring nature on two feet. A journey that led to discovering the transformative power of gratitude. To touching and unlocking a deeper, more meaningful part of himself.  And to eclipsing the void beyond the limits of his preconceived physical, mental and emotional capabilities.Despite an ultra-running career that began just 5 years ago in 2009, it didn’t take long before he was racking up big wins in big-time races. But everything blew wide open in  2012  when Timothy didn’t just cross the finish line first at the Western States 100 trail race — one of the most prestigious 100-mile ultra-running races on the planet — he destroyed the field, crushing the previous course record by a full 20 minutes.  Imagine running 100 miles on steep elevation trails in thin high altitude air in just 14 hours and 46 minutes.No one hit wonder, Timothy returned to the WS 100 in  2013  and won it again decisively.This July, Timothy’s eyes are firmly set on the Hardrock 100  — a 100-mile trail run that entails 34,000 feet of climbing, 68,000 feet of total elevation change at an average elevation of 11,000 feet.  This is what we call hardcore.To be sure, what Timothy has accomplished and will no doubt continue to accomplish on the trail is nothing short of remarkable, particularly in light of where he was in life just a few short years ago. But quite honestly, I am less interested in his victories and athleticism than I am in what got him there. I am convinced that the essential ingredient in Timothy’s success equation is his unique perspective on life. His soul surfer approach to sport. Timothy is a guy who knows real pain.  Someone who has lived in the pitch black prison with no means for escape. Somehow, and against all odds, he found the keys to freedom and emerged on the other side not just intact, but whole. A man driven to continuously find, explore and embrace the love and the light in what he’s doing, a living ambassador of his favorite social media hashtag: #neverstopexploring.Living close to nature. Minimally and with priorities straight. At peace. On the trail. As a husband. A dad. A man.  A complete, authentic, actualized man currently in the full force of his talent and power. A man questing the fringes of his own personal enlightenment, motivated by great compassion.One bodhisattva in my life moves on.  Another enters.  And I am grateful for both.This is the cycle and what makes life beautiful. So breathe it in. Appreciate it with all of who you are. Embrace the gratitude. Find the moment. Take the risk. Leap into the void. And make it everything. In this you will find the beauty of who you are.I told you I’d bring it around.I hope you enjoy the conversation.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

March 24, 2014

A few weeks back I had the pleasure of being a keynote speaker & instructor on the  Holistic Holiday at Sea  — 1500 people cohabiting for 7 days on a Caribbean cruise ship for the specific purpose of learning more about health. How to eat better. And live more fully.When I agreed to participate, I had no idea the magnitude of this event. The incredible scale of this thing. I’m not a cruise ship kind of guy.  Quite honestly, I prefer a shack on a deserted beach to a floating mall housing 2200.I was leery.In the aftermath, I can’t say the experience converted me to cruising as a lifestyle. But I will say it ended up being an extraordinary experience — an event I highly recommend to those out there looking for something different to kick things into a new gear. I got to meet and spend time with some of the leading minds in the plant-based wellness Universe. Some I already knew, like legends T. Colin Campbell, author of  The China Study*  and  Whole*  (podcast coming soon!),  PCRM  founder  Neal Barnard,  Chef AJ  ( RRP Episode 56 ), bodybuilder  Robert Cheeke, fitness impresario  Koya Webb  and many others.But what made the experience so memorable was meeting and spending time with people I had never before met. Presenters like today’s guest of course, but mostly just normal people interested in learning more about getting better — and sharing their intimate stories. And so – despite my preconceived notions of what this experience would hold – I left rather inspired.  By the lives and experiences and struggles and obstacles people face. And the success stories of overcoming everything from obesity to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, food addictions and more to live happier, healthier and more fulfilling lives.Leeriness transformed. A win-win.Today’s guest is one of the guys I met on the cruise.  I guy who I’ve admired from afar for some time, but had yet to meet.Dr. Michael Klaper.A rare bird this one.  A physician who actually really cares about the patient.  Before you get angry and defensive about docs — I’m not saying that doctors don’t care about their patients.  I am saying that this insane institutionalized system of medicine we have created basically forces well intentioned docs from getting too invested in their patients.  They just can’t.  Economics prevents this kind of time and emotional investment.Well, Dr. Klaper is a guy who got fed up with that system – like Peter Finch’s epic famous lament in Paddy Chayefsky’s Network — I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore! – and started treating patients the way he felt they should be treated.  It wasn’t exactly the best business plan – there was the time he went broke trying to make it work.  It’s that hard to do. But his story, his message. and how he now makes it all work, is educational.  And inspirational.“Health comes from healthy living.”As an acute care physician for many years practicing in many locales (Canada, New Zealand, Hawaii and now Northern California), Dr. K began to realize that many of the diseases his patients brought to his office – clogged arteries (atherosclerosis), high blood pressure (hypertension), obesity, adult onset diabetes, and even some forms of arthritis, asthma, and other significant illnesses – were made worse, or actually caused, by the high-fat, high sugar, overly processed Standard American Diet (S.A.D.).Not dissimilar to  Dr. Frank Lipman  ( RRP Episode 72 ), Dr. Klaper came to understand how crucial proper nutrition and a balanced lifestyle are essential for health and, in many cases, make the difference between healing an illness, preventing an illness and even reversing an illness versus merely treating the symptoms – or masking them with drugs that have no impact on dealing with the illness’ cause.So he began to treat his patients accordingly – with astounding results.In addition to being on staff physician at  TrueNorth Health Center  in Santa Rosa, California — a nutritionally-based medical clinic specializing in therapeutic fasting and health improvement through a whole-foods, plant-based diet — Dr. Klaper is also a pilot.  A teacher. An author. And generally a great, very kind and giving, affable guy.  A throwback to the friendly family docs of a byegone era.  The trusty guy who would make house calls in the middle of the night (which he did). Sit and have tea with your mom while you lied in your bed upstairs with a thermometer in your mouth.All I can say is that I hope I look as good and have as much energy as he does when I’m his age.A few weeks back he sat down with me — in his little cabin on this huge boat smack in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle — to tell us all about his journey.Let’s see if we make it out alive….Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

482,Osher Günsberg,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-76-osher-gunsberg-from-chubby-kid-to-plantpowered-marathon-running-host-of-australian-idol/,"Episode 76
March 17, 2014

I’m told that Osher Gunsberg is quite the thing Down Under. Under former stage name Andrew G he lit up Australian airwaves as host of the popular Channel V— the Oz version of MTV’s TRL— and went on to host  Australian Idol,  Live to Dance  here in US with Paula Abdul, and more recently was the guy giving out roses back in his homeland on  The Bachelor.That stuff is cool I suppose. Good on ya mate. But that’s not how I know Osher. In fact, I’ve never seen him once on television and didn’t even know about any of that stuff until we had hung out several times. Moreover, it really has nothing to do with why I wanted to sit down and bend his ear.I know Osher just as a good friend. We met about a year ago and he has become one of my closer friends over this period of time.  I guy I can call up, and with whom I can talk life things through — because he has endured and overcome similar challenges and always has a wise word or two that helps me navigate whatever I happen to be going through. A guy who knows how to really appreciate a good long trail run. And a guy I can share stories with on a cycling excursion in my local Santa Monica Mountains.Of course you like this guy – he’s the spitting image of you! What is this, some kind of weird self-love thing?Yeah, yeah. If you see the photo that accompanies this episode it is kind of weird. Like my twin brother or something – the resemblance in that image is admittedly a bit comical. Same glasses, stubble, t-shirt, hair, etc. Yeah that’s funny. I like to joke that he is my doppelgänger. In truth we actually don’t look all that much alike in person – it’s just how that particular photo came out. Trust me, Osher is much more handsome and charming than me, as you will soon see.But I guess there is some truth to the dopplegänger idea below the surface. Like me, Osher is a plant-based guy. Distance runner. Recent cycling convert (I’m cajoling him into signing up for his first triathlon). Not to mention a guy who has weathered divorce (although not sure you can characterize what I went through back in ’96 as really much of a “marriage” or a “divorce” – if you read my book, you’ll get my meaning).If you are a long time listener to the show then you’ll remember I had Osher on back in May ( Episode 30 ) to interview me as a fun turning of the tables to correspond with the paperback release of Finding Ultra*. Because he is such a broadcasting pro at all of this he was the logical choice — and it was a ton of fun.But the more I got to know him, the more I realized he has a compelling story in his own right that I really wanted to help tell. Like some of our previous guests, a guy who has struggled with many relatable things in life we can connect with emotionally. A chubby kid and junk food addict determined to find a way out of his situation, he found success and improved self-esteem by way of a plant-based diet and learning how to run. A journey that now finds him enjoying marathons and cycling.More than that, we have a really interesting discussion about divorce – and because of the way our society is configured, how it can be so difficult for men in particular to to heal from this “adventure” in a healthy way. A way he found through a  core set of spiritual principles to ground, orient and guide his emotional and mental and physical energy and overall life trajectory.So if you are going through some of the same things in your life, I think you will find the discussion really really interesting.Plus, Osher is just a great bloke. And the boy is a total professional when it comes to interesting conversation – which makes me look good and my job easy. So there’s that.Joking inside, I think you will our time compelling – it will make you think about certain things and leave you inspired.  At least that’s how I felt. If you dig the talk, then you will dig his podcast: The Osher Günsberg Podcast– check it out!Enjoy the listen. Enjoy your week.PS – As I sit here writing this, the biggest earthquake I have felt in years just rocked the house.  So far everything seems to be intact.  Keep ya posted.SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

483,James Altucher,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-75-james-altucher-why-choose-yourself/,"Episode 75
March 10, 2014

I love people who ask questions other people aren’t asking. See trends others don’t see. Have the courage to try a new approach. Risk the illusion of security. Think differently. Jump into the abyss with nothing but faith and their own resolve in search of answers. And refuse to wait for permission to simply do.In a certain sense, this dictate can be boiled down to a singular principle — people who Choose Themselves.And this is what today’s guest is all about.Enter  James Altucher.Where to even begin with this multi-talented hyphenate. Hedge fund manager, investor & serial entrepreneur, James has founded or co-founded over 20 companies; chess master; inspirational public speaker, radio, television and successful podcast host ( his show  debuted at #1 on all of iTunes a few months back); bestselling author with 11 books to his name, both self-published and with the biggest publishing houses; husband, and father.I first stumbled upon the world of James Altucher about a year ago through his prolific, always humorous discernments on his The Altucher Confidential Blog and have counted myself a rabid fan ever since.What keeps me coming back isn’t just his keen perceptions and invaluable insights, but the honesty, authenticity and total transparency as a vehicle to deliver his perceptions. A self-deprecating style that astutely mines his many fears and failures with a profound degree of relatability that threads a fabric of deep emotional connection with his readership. An expert in navigating rejection and colossal failure with as much enthusiasm and authority as his lays out — brick-by-brick — the many principles he has honed and freely shares to achieve greater health, perspective, life satisfaction and prosperity.We live in precarious times. A fear-based, quickly changing world pulling the thinly veiled curtain on the illusion of security. To crib a few ideas from James, markets have crashed. The traditional idea of jobs are disappearing. Everything we thought was “safe,” no longer is: College. Employment. Retirement. Government. In every part of society, the middlemen are being pushed out of the picture. No longer is someone coming to hire you, to invest in your company, to sign you, to pick you. More than ever, it falls on the individual to create a sustainable future.Scary stuff.We can look at this as a crisis.  Or we can change perspective and see it as a moment of great opportunity. As always, destruction begets renewal.  The truth is that we live in an amazing, unprecedented time of opportunity. A time of fantastical technology that in many ways has simply eradicated the seat once occupied by what we call the gatekeepers. With the advent of mind-blowing software and social media, new tools and economic forces are emerging that make it more possible than ever for individuals to create, thrive and change the world without “help” from the finicky sometimes not so permissive hand traditionally relied upon to feed us.This is the idea behind what James would call the  Choose Yourself*  era.  It’s also the title of his most recent book, a roadmap primer on transcending the decaying the master/servant paradigm of our economic system of employment and a call to action on how to configure a more meaningful life liberated from the so-called gatekeepers.With a keen wit and finely honed insight, James is a guy who sees, understands and can translate life principles in a way that will both challenge and humor you.I encourage all of you to read his book and the many articles on his blog, then experiment by incorporating his tools into your life.So there you go.I hope you enjoy today’s conversation.  I certainly did.  Let me know what you think in the comments below.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

484,Jonathan Fields,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-74-jonathan-fields-on-leveraging-mindfulness-to-change-your-life/,"Episode 74
March 3, 2014

Jonathan Fields is a super popular guy. There is a good reason for that, which I’m going to get into in a minute.Before I do, I wanted to check in with you in a bit about what we do over here at the RRP. I have the feeling that Jonathan’s appeal will attract some cool new people to the audience (welcome!), so I wanted to take a quick moment to recap the mission.Yes, I am a plant-based endurance athlete. And yes, I do have many plant-based enthusiasts on this show. But this is hardly a narrowly defined “fitness” or “vegan” themed podcast. It’s far more about inspiration. I cast a very broad net. When thinking about guests, my litmus test is finding fascinating people and personalities that span a variety of disciplines. People who push boundaries. Live extraordinary lives. Think different. Blaze their own path.  Question the status quo. And live large and on their own terms – in service not just to themselves, but in devotion to others, catalyzing life changing improvement in the quality of people’s lives, and overall simply raising the bar on what is possible.I deliver these conversations with the sole intention of providing you with a stocked tool-box of education, information, motivation and inspiration to help you take the quality of your life to the next level. The goal? To assist in helping you unlock and unleash your best most authentic self. That’s it. Pure and simple.Last week I published an article entitled, “Why You Should Stop Lifehacking and Invest in the Journey”  (also up on Medium ). I wrote it because I have been thinking a lot lately about self-improvement.  More specifically our shortcutting, lifehacking, biohacking obsessed culture. This meme-fueled drive to circumvent process and expedite results. In and of itself fine. I’m all about efficiencies. But there is something that really bothers me about this trend because on a certain some level it downgrades the inherent value of process. Disrespect for the journey. And the blood, sweat, tears and joy from simply showing up and suiting up for the full commitment.To me, the journey is everything. That is where the value lies. It’s a sentiment that was echoed in last weeks podcast episode with Casey Neistat – a guy who overcame tremendous obstacles with nothing but faith, will, belief and total commitment to process.And it’s an ethos that really captures what today’s guest is all about. All in all, a guy who understands the long-term value of the journey over the temporary thrill of the #lifehack.Jonathan Fields. Dad. Husband,  serial-entrepreneur, award-winning, bestselling author, speaker, A-list blogger, web-show host, and mindful innovation strategist who has been profiled in pretty much every prestigious publication there is, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, FastCompany, and Forbes. A guy I have been following with great enthusiasm to my tremendous benefit for years.On a personal level, Jonathan is guy I can deeply relate to – a guy (like me) who decided to leave the gilded protective hallways of the corporate law firm existence and risk everything in search of a life path of greater meaning for himself and others.  Well Jonathan found it — in spades.  His mission? To humanize and empower the process of creation. To help people and organizations conceive and build better, more conscious businesses, art, and lives in less time, with more joy and less effort.What gives Jonathan’s particular brand of entrepreneurship such resonance with me personally is his inherent focus on process over results. Emphasis on the journey over the destination. An understanding that authenticity is everything. And that mindfulness lays forth the path. This is reflected in everything he does, from his writing and public speaking to his online educational courses and most importantly his life.I had the honor of being interviewed by Jonathan last year for an episode of his Good Life Project web series — an exploration of lives well-lived featuring conversations with acclaimed entrepreneurs, artists and authors you should most definitely check out — and I am so pleased that he reciprocated, taking the time to sit down with me in New York a few weeks back.I sincerely hope you enjoy this conversation with one of the most considerate and empowering people I have the good fortune to know.Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

485,Casey Neistat,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-73-casey-neistat-on-making-it-count-and-how-to-do-more/,"Episode 73
February 24, 2014

“Work hard and be brave.”Casey NeistatSimple yet profound words from this week’s guest, a man in full embrace of the ethos of living an impactful, creative, authentic life in overdrive.Uncompromising. Unapologetic. Filmmaker, photographer, builder, father, humanitarian, athlete. But most of all, an artist leveraging his boundless creative energy to tell personal stories that inspire all of us to find the adventure in life. To invest in experience. To be bold. And to do more — both for yourself and for others.I first became aware of Casey around 2010 when his show “The Neistat Brothers” aired on HBO and was immediately captivated by Casey’s DIY sensibility. His fearlessness. His acute ability to find the wonder in the seemingly banal. And his refusal to await permission from the gatekeepers to create. I’ve been a fan ever since, eagerly anticipating each new upload to his wildly popular YouTube channel — 82 movies he refuses to monetize; a network that enjoys a quarter of a million rabid subscribers; and dozens of viral sensations with 50+ million views.At this point, many of you have likely seen his remarkable “Make It Count”. If you somehow missed it, please watch it now for context before listening to the episode (I’ve watched it at least 20 times and never get tired of it). Hired by Nike to create an advertisement to promote the Fuel Band, Casey audaciously ignored the agreed upon commercial treatment and instead brashly spent the entire budget traveling the world, all the while documenting his incredible adventure until the money just flat ran out. 34,000 miles, three continents, 13 countries, 16 cities and 10 million views later, the rest is history.This past December, Casey raised the bar. Contacted by 20th Century Fox to create a movie to help promote “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty”, Casey agreed, with one caveat: permission to donate the entire commercial budget to typhoon victims in the Philippines. Tying creative expression to service,   “What Would You Do with $25,000?” became an instant viral hit, trending on Twitter to over 3 million views.Then just one day after we sat down for this conversation, Casey headed out in a blizzard to “Snowboard NYC”— a sponsor-less lark he posted within 24 hours of shooting that clocked 5 million views in it’s first five days.In the words of Wired Magazine, “Casey Neistat’s bite-size Internet movies have so much viral potential they make influenza jealous.” But what is it that makes Casey and his work so irresistible?  Sure, the movies are fun.  Irreverant.  Visually captivating with great music and personal storylines that always star Casey himself as the ever-appealing protagonist.But in my opinion, what makes Casey stand out, what gives his work permanent residence in my consciousness, is his devotion to authenticity — an axiom of conviction that infuses every single frame of every single work he produces — and the predominant over-arching theme of this podcast.It was a treat to drop in on Casey’s Lower Manhattan studio —  “one of the most compulsively organized, ridiculously customized, and mind-bogglingly gear-saturated spaces on Planet Awesome”  — and I am super pumped to bring you this powerful conversation with a life premised upon creative passion, a tireless work ethic, a conviction to constantly invest in experience above everything, and an oftentimes logic-defying faith in the journey.Something I like to call the warrior path.Listen with ears open. Objectively ponder the limitless possibilities presented in your own life. Then — to echo the words permanently inked on Casey’s forearm — DO MORE.The awesome black & white photo of Casey (below and in the above YouTube clip) is courtesy of the incredibly talented Manfredi Gioacchini.  Check out his website and follow him on Instagram !Peace + Plants,Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.

486,Dr. Frank Lipman,https://www.richroll.com/podcast/rrp-72-dr-frank-lipman-preventive-integrative-holistic-wellness/,"Episode 72
February 17, 2014

We need more doctors in the world like Dr. Frank Lipman.Western medicine is astounding when it comes to treating acute, isolated conditions — a catastrophic injury, an arterial blockage or a serious infection, for example.  But how does it fare when it comes to preventing disease, particularly chronic illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, obesity and countless other conditions sweeping the globe like a modern day plague? Well, not so well. On this I think we can all agree.On that note, when was the last time your doctor focused his inquiry on things like increasing energy levels and general vitality, elevating mood, sustaining optimal body weight, or enhancing mental acuity and focus?  Not recently I would imagine, if ever.  He or she might advise you to reduce the stress in your life, “eat better” and/or “start taking care of yourself” — but these proclamations are rarely combined with an actual specific protocol to implement. And that, my friends is a shame.Dr. Lipman is working to break this paradigm.  Early in his medical career, he began to see that the polarization between western modalities and other healing philosophies merely negated positive attributes of both. He began to see that true healing lay in a blend between the two. He now practices his unique method of what he calls “Good Medicine”, which merges the best of the west with many traditions more eastern or alternative in origin — a holistic form of medicine that is truly unique and integrative in its approach to patients.  It’s for this reason he has become the go-to, in-demand doctor for the celebrated — people like Donna Karan, Kevin Bacon, Gwenyth Paltrow, Peter Sarsgaard & Maggie Gyllenhaal.If pharmaceuticals are truly in order to rectify an acute medical issue, he is happy to prescribe. But disease management isn’t what gets him out of bed every morning excited about life. Instead, it’s taking the time to evaluate each patient as a complex web of interdependent systems, with a keen lens focused on disease prevention.  The idea is to optimize the quality of his patients’ lives through implementing techniques such as acupuncture; Chinese, herbal & functional medicine; nutrition; biofeedback; meditation; and yoga.When was the last time your doctor prescribed you to go to yoga? It’s never happened to me, and I live in LA.In short, Dr. Lipman’s ultimate goal for all his patients is simple: sustained, long-term, optimal wellness.Sustained, long-term, optimal wellness.If you know me, then you know I’m all about this subject.  So it was an honor and a treat to sit down with Dr. Lipman in his office at Eleven Eleven Wellness Center in the Flatiron District of Manhattan — with its soothing meditation retreat / yoga studio vibe — where he generously offered up his perspective on medicine & the medical profession, nutrition & food allergies, and the types of things we can and should all focus on more intently if we want to maximize our “wellness” in the truest sense of this all-too often over-hyped word.I hope you enjoy the enlightening conversation.  Leave a comment below and let me know what you think.  And don’t forget to give Tyler — my trusty podcast producer and stepson — a nice shoutout for all his hard work not just putting today’s show together, but for all his amazing original music compositions that accompany the interview. Thanks Ty!SHOW NOTESConnect With Dr. Frank Lipman: Website  | Facebook | Twitter | Youtube

Straight up, this conversation encapsulates every aspiration I ever had for the show when I embarked upon this podcast journey a little over a year ago: inspiration, in the form of a relatable everyman guest sharing his personal story openly and honestly with absolute humility and a vulnerability that is rare in today’s panoply of admirable role models.We get emotional. We get real. We get authentic.  There’s even a few tears.  If you’re not moved by Adam’ story, then check yourself for a pulse.” Adam Scully-Power ? Never heard of him.”I get it.  Adam certainly isn’t a household name. But that’s a shame, because we need more guys like Adam.  So I’m doing my part to help change that, because Adam’s story is extraordinary.  And one that needs to be more widely heard.I’ll start off with this — talking to Adam was like staring in a mirror.  Not because we look alike – we don’t.  But I have never met anyone with a story that so closely tracks the facts and emotions my own experience. In fact, it’s downright eerie.  So let’s break it down.Much like me, Adam is a happily married family man and father of four.Much like me, Adam had a denial-snapping middle-aged come-to-Jesus moment of reckoning catalyzed by his ever-expanding waistline, quickly deteriorating energy levels and dissatisfaction with his overworked, all-too-sedentary corporate lifestyle.Much like me, Adam turned to his health-conscious wife for a little guidance, who at the time had been experimenting — and finding success — with a plant-based way of eating.Much like me, and with nothing to lose, Adam decided to give this insane idea of just eating plants a whirl.Here’s the Cliff Notes on what happens next: Adam’s energy levels explode.  Almost overnight, the extra pounds around Adam’s waist melt away, seemingly without effort.  With a vitality he could not previously recall, and for the first time in years, Adam resumes a modest fitness program to burn off all the extra energy coursing through his veins. But incapable of contentedness with “the occasional jog” Adam instead sets his sights higher.  So high, in fact, he becomes determined to achieve his own personal impossible.Overwhelmed by the tragedy of last year’s Boston Marathon, driven by an undeniable primal urge to test the outer limits of his physical, mental, emotional and spiritual limits, and propelled by a series of eerie, impossibly synchronistic and equally improbable events — including an image texted to him by his friend David Green from the Boston Marathon finish line that led to the capture of bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev —  last summer Adam lined up to attempt the unimaginable.  An unprecedented 163-mile run across the entire state of Massachusetts.Adam accomplished this feat. Not in spite of his plant-based diet, but because of his plant-based diet.  A feat made all the more remarkable because it occurred only one year subsequent to his epiphanic, life-changing moment of reckoning.To be sure, Adam Scully-Power’s story of life transformation is nothing short of miraculous.  An extraordinary journey that didn’t just repair his health and resolve his waistline dilemma, but instead resulted in astonishing heights of accomplishment he could have never previously imagined in his wildest fantasy.  A story of such dramatic life transformation you will be left in tears — and beyond inspired.Of course, not all of us have the desire to test ourselves as ultrarunners.  That’s not the point.  What’s important is the power that resides within all of us to change, achieve and be so much more than we think we can.  Inside all of us resides a better, more authentic version of ourselves yearning to be expressed.  It’s never too late.  And when desire meets faith, there is always a way.May this conversation be of service to you along the path of your own journey of greater self-realization and expression, in whatever form that may take.The image captured by Adam’s friend David Green that ultimately led to the capture of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and catalyzed Adam’s drive to attempt his 163-mile run.SHOW NOTES:*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

American Ninja Warrior.  Calisthenics freak.  Battlebar champion.  Muscle Beach staple.  Parkour artist.  Spiritual crusader. Social entrepreneur.These are just a few labels we can attach to the badass known as Travis Brewer.  But what is truly inspiring about this airborne athlete with a conscience is his mission to live life to the fullest. Catalyzing positive impact through movement to make the world a better place.  And inspire others to become more of who they are.For Travis, it’s an inside job.  His ability to walk through fear, break barriers, push past physical, mental and emotional plateaus to perform the impossible with death-defying body movement begins and ends with one thing – his devotion to spirituality & meditation.Today Julie and I sit down with Travis to explore the boundaries of human potential – both athletic and beyond the monkey bars; what it truly means to unlock the best of who you are; the crucial extent to which devotion, spirituality and meditation play into his holistic health and peak performance equation; and how he pursues happiness and life satisfaction through service to others.Travis is a fascinating, insightful, considerate and contemplative young man with big dreams for the future of youth, health, movement and entrepreneurship. It was an honor to have him spend an evening with our family, and I’m thrilled to share this conversation with you.Enjoy!All images of Travis courtesy of ©  PJ Russ  – thanks PJ!To set the stage, here’s a short little inspiring video on Travis that will give you a sense of his groovy vibe.And here’s a gander at one of the insanely cool, gargantuan “bird’s nest” art piece creations Travis has a hand in building, as we discuss on the show.  Must have!SHOW NOTESAudible.com FREE Audiobook & 30-Day Trial: http://www.audiblepodcast.com/richrollHOW CAN I SUPPORT THE PODCAST?1.

January 23, 2014

What do you do when your twelve-year-old son announces he’s going to run across America?That’s the dilemma Brett & Kris Wilcox faced, hoping that in time their son David would simply forget about his crazy idea —“it’s a phase….he’ll grow out of this fantasy eventually……right?”Well, David refused to let up.  In fact, he doubled down.  On the heels of becoming the fastest freshman cross country runner in his region of Alaska, David became more determined than ever to become the 2nd 15-year old ever to complete a transcontinental run.Needless to say, his parents had a decision to make – quash their son’s dream, or dig deep to help make it happen.  I am happy to say they chose the latter. And on January 18, 2014, David and his father — supported by his mother Kris and 13-year old sister Olivia — began their coast-to-coast attempt, launching from Huntington Beach, CA en route to Washington, D.C.David has his motivations.  But in order to run alongside his son, Brett needed his own.As a Licensed Professional Counselor, Brett has spent his career helping people heal from the poison and pain they’ve endured at the hands of bullies and batterers.  Now, he’s turned his attention to global bullies—bullies like the giant chemical companies that poison the Earth, our political processes and our agricultural system. The author of We’re Monsanto: Feeding the World Lie After Lie*, Brett knows a thing or two about GMO’s, the ills of factory farming, the depletion of our soil, and the future of food.So Brett — and David — are running across America to say enough is enough. And during the course of our conversation we dig deep into these issues — what exactly these companies are doing to our food system, why we should care, and what we can do about it.It’s a fascinating conversation and one I am proud to share with you.  What this humble family has set out to accomplish is extraordinary.  But they can’t do it alone.  Every great accomplishment requires the support of a great team.  They need all the help they can get.  So let’s be that team for them.  Towards that end, I implore you to visit their Indiegogo fundraising page and — if it feels right to you — consider contributing to their mission and advocacy — a cause that affects us all, irrespective of dietary preference, geographical location or political prediliction.I hope you enjoy the conversation!NOTE: Unfortunately we did experience some audio quality issues with the recording.  Just when I think I have this whole thing figured out!  Something about my mic being too hot and the others lower.  I don’t know.  Tyler worked really hard to clean it up, but it’s not perfect.  Hope it’s not too distracting, and all I can say is that I will continue to try harder, learn and do better.  Give Tyler a shoutout in the comments below, he’s doing a great job as my producer.  And all the music cues are his own original compositions.SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

January 16, 2014

Matt is a cool dude.  Can’t believe it took the podcast for us to finally meet in person.Not only do we have plenty of common points of interest and intersection — plant-based nutrition, eating for performance and ultra-endurance athletics topping the list — Matt knows from whence he comes.With a Nutritional Science degree from Pennsylvania State University and a Public Health Nutrition degree from Loma Linda University (yes – that “Blue Zone*” Loma Linda where everyone eats plants and lives like forever – don’t worry we get into this), as well as certification as a Registered Dietitian ( the only professional nutrition credential available ), Matt has distinguished himself as a leading expert in the field of vegan nutrition.In addition to working one-on-one with clients and athletes, Matt is the Past-Chair of the  Vegetarian Nutrition Group of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics , and co-authored both the  No Meat Athlete  book with RRP #54 guest Matt Frazier  and the best-selling cookbook  Appetite for Reduction*  with Isa Moskowitz.  In his spare time, Matt is an accomplished athlete who races marathons, iron-man triathlons, 200+ mile cycling events and 24-hour races (see full  athletic resume ).During the course of our conversation we dig into all of it – the paleo vs. vegan “debate”, how to eat for ultra-endurance performance, modern advocacy in the world of our broken food system, and how corporate interests use marketing to obfuscate fact, undermine informed consent and confuse consumer choice.But quite possibly the most impressive thing about Matt? He lives in Southern California yet refuses to own a car.  Now that is commitment.Listen with an open mind, and may the conversation raise the vibration & inspire your best self.  Enjoy!SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

January 9, 2014

People ask me all the time, “Who inspires you, Rich?”For the most part, the people that inspire me are people you’ve never heard of.  Everyman guys like Josh LaJaunie who toil tirelessly yet essentially anonymously to actualize profound personal change.  The single dad working two jobs that still finds a way to lose 50 pounds, get off his statin medication and run his first 10K.  Or the soldier stationed in the Middle East doing his best to eat plant-based despite confronting tremendous daily obstacles.Then there are guys like Charlie.The story of Charlie Engle first found it’s way into my consciousness back around 2006 or 2007.  I still vividly recall hearing Charlie relate the facts of his experience in a radio interview he did with a host I cannot recall.  What I do recall is just how moved I was by his journey.  A story that didn’t just click with me, but one I related to with every fiber of who I am.Addict.  Alcoholic.  Sober. Ultrarunner.  Father.  Felon.  Inspiration.Charlie is a man of very high highs and very low lows.  A man with addiction and athletic stories of Gilgamesh proportions that make Finding Ultra sound like pre-school recess.  An alcoholic crack addict essentially living out of his car, it took gunshots in his Toyota 4-Runner and the birth of his son in 1992 to finally get sober.  Ultrarunning became the focus of his affections, an affair that took him to stunning heights and accolades, the nadir being an unprecedented 111-day run across the Sahara Desert with compadres Ray Zahab and Kevin Lin — a feat chronicled in the Matt Damon narrated documentary entitled Running the Sahara.Life was pretty good.  Certainly not entirely balanced, but hey, nobody’s perfect.  He had done some amazing things. Maybe he had a shot at some modicum of happiness after all.Then came quite possibly the most improbable, unpredictable challenge he could ever imagine facing.  A saga with all the trappings of a bad B-movie.  An obsessed local IRS agent illogically hell-bent on justice.  Wire taps.  Garbage probes.  And the requisite wily female dispatched to enchant and entrap.  A saga culminating in a federal conviction for mortgage fraud for misstating income on so-called “liar loan” documents (something hundreds of thousands of people did), Charlie heads to Beckley Federal Prison in West Virginia.  A poster child for everything awry with the mortgage backed security crisis and fallout of recent years, Charlie serves 16 months.How do you survive something like that?And yet Charlie comes out the other side not just intact, but quite possibly more whole than when he entered.  A man changed by the experience, but maybe more attuned to what really matters.And a man running better than ever.  Just one year after his release, Charlie returned to the Badwater 135 to clock a 5th place finish and break the master’s world record by over 3 hours.  Next up?  Aside from getting married this weekend, Charlie will attempt to run across the United States faster than any human being ever has previously.  A feat he calls Run 2 Boston, Charlie and wheelchair athlete extraordinaire André Kajlic will line up at the LA Marathon on March 9, complete the 26.2 miles and then just keep going.  And going.  Until they reach Boston, where they will run that marathon.  All in an effort to raise funds and awareness for the victim’s of last years’ Boston Marathon bombing.  The idea is to complete the distance in 44 days, which means averaging 70 miles a day.70 miles of running every day for 44 days straight.Wow.  Is that even possible?  And after everything he has endured, why?  For the nitty gritty, you’ll have to tune in.  This is a conversation I’ve been dying to have for a very long time, and it didn’t disappoint.  I hope you enjoy it.By the way, if you haven’t seen Running the Sahara, check it out (you can watch it on Netflix) – here’s the trailer:P.S. – We’re a TOP FINALIST for a 2013 Stitcher Award for BEST HEALTH + LIFESTYLE PODCAST!   Stitcher.com— one of the web’s largest podcast distribution platforms —  is currently taking votes through 1/13 to decide the year’s best podcasts.

S$#*t’s about to get raw. Authentic. And real.Back by popular demand, Cro-Mags’ frontman John Joseph— aka “Bloodclot” — returns to the podcast today to do what he does best – light fires, blow stuff up and burn the house down.  All for the sake of getting people to wake up, expand consciousness and take control of our lives.Weaned from the ailing womb of Scorsese’s Mean Streets, JJ is a true American original. Lower East Side thief, abuse survivor, drug dealer & brawling gutter rat reborn as spiritual warrior. CBGB Street Poet. Punk-ass Robin Hood. Plantpowered Ironman. Spiritual evangelist. A life story so astounding it echoes some demented amalgam of Bukowski, Hugh Selby, Jr., Jerry Stahl, Eckhart Tolle & Paramahansa Yogananda.Plus he can write. His tale of survival is so vividly depicted in his autobiography Evolution of a Cro-Magnon, it’s currently being adapted into a movie. And July 2014 brings Harper Collins’ wide release of his previously self-published (and currently out-of-print) cult hit Meat is For Pussies*— with a foreword by yours truly.But more anything, this boy can spin a yarn. JJ’s first appearance on the podcast was a massive hit, and we barely scratched the surface of John’s ability to opine and pontificate on a vast array of subjects — life on the streets, GMO’s, Monsanto, the strange history of Aspartame, the power of meditation, the importance of expanding consciousness, the problems with the “V” word, what it means to be truly punk in this post-millenia era, and why meat really is for pussies.If you’re new to the show, be sure to check out JJ’s previous appearance in RRP 41. It’s like a bomb exploding in an elevator.Thanks for stopping by, happy holidays, and I hope you enjoy our conversation!P.S. – Stitcher.com is currently taking votes through 12/24 for it’s annual 2013 Stitcher Awards for best podcasts.

December 16, 2013

Third time’s a charm.Show favorite Mishka Shubaly returns to the podcast today for round 3 to chat about addiction, sobriety, rock ‘n roll, ultrarunning, relationships, writing, creativity and his fantastic new Kindle Single, Beat The Devil.But mostly we talk about chasing dreams.  The inherent force, value & gestalt of a dream.  How much you are willing to sacrifice in pursuit of a dream, even when it constantly deludes and eludes you, undermining, derailing and even destroying other important aspects of your life.  How to know whether the dream you seek is the right dream.  And when — and if — it ever makes sense to abandon a dream that persistently fails to materialize.Mishka and I have a shorthand.  A large percentage of our friendship has taken place on microphone, but there is a palpable sense that we have always been friends.  And that’s because — although our life experiences are very different — our mental & emotional points of reference share powerful common turf.  Indeed, Mishka is my brother-from-another-mother; and once again it comes through undeniably in this exchange.Our bond aside, I feel an imperative to share his palpable creative voice.  A master of humility, self-deprecation, frailty and fear, his evocative prose is a dagger into the heart we all share — our common condition as human.  It’s an important voice, worthy of notice and praise.  An opinion I harbor not in isolation, but one shared by the literati, including a top editor at The Atlantic who goes so far as to say Mishka is “the voice of our generation”.  That phrase gets bandied about all too commonly, but in Mishka’s case it’s truth.  With 4 consecutive Amazon #1 bestsellers ( Shipwrecked*, The Long Run*, Are You Lonesome Tonight?*  and  Bachelor Number One* ) he is a true master of the short narrative.  Now he’s back at it.   Beat The Devil*— his newest offering — just hit #1 in Amazon’s Kindle Singles category yesterday.A deep dive into the downtown New York rock ‘n roll club scene, Beat The Devil* is Mishka’s first-hand account of battling his ultimate demon and addiction: his obsession with rock ‘n’ roll. Over three decades, this affliction has spawned immeasurable chaos and destruction (and, yes, maybe some debauched good times). While his rivals graced the covers of Spin and Rolling Stone, Shubaly’s projects always flamed out in the eleventh hour. At 36, sober and stable, Shubaly is poised to finally achieve the rock ‘n’ roll glory he has lusted after for years… or walk away from his lifelong dream forever.  Shubaly spares no gory detail in this autopsy of his wasted years and Beat The Devil* is rife with vivid behind-the-scenes desperation borne out of chasing an unattainable dream.Everything that has endeared Shubaly to his readers is here: his resistance to common sense, his inability to accept defeat, his probing intellect, and his heart. Do yourself a service a pick up this literary gem.  At $1.99, it’s less than the price of a coffee at Starbucks with a bittersweet aftertaste that will haunt, charm and never leave you.  Plus it’s short – at 73 pages it will only take you about 90 minutes to read the whole thing.  Prefer his voice? It’s available in audiobook format as well – Mishka himself reading it.  And if you enjoy it as much as I know you will, do him a solid and give it a kind review on Amazon.  Let’s support this guy!Finally, the episode takes us out with Mishka’s new single: I Can’t Remember When You Were Mine.  If you dig his vibe, check out his tunes on Bandcamp.  Finally, finally, that’s Mishka’s nephew in the picture – not his son.Thanks for dropping by and I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.NOTE: Some explicit language, so pop the earbuds in if you are at work or driving around with the kiddies.If you are new to the show and new to Mishka, then you might enjoy our two previous podcast conversations.  Check out Episode 27 & Episode 31.SHOW NOTESConnect With Mishka: Website | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

Now for something a little different.  In celebration of our 1st year anniversary and the quickly approaching new year, I thought it would be fun to compile a “Best Of” edition of the show, with excerpts from some of the more popular interviews over the course of the past twelve months to create a year-end mashup episode.So Tyler, my son and esteemed podcast producer, audio engineer and musician (he writes, produces and arranges all the music for the show as well) rolled up his sleeves and went to work, spending hours culling through the best and the brightest of 2013 to create today’s show – a full-length compendium of awesome, it’s a veritable grab-bag cornucopia of amazing conversational clips edited together to create a complete show.  Excerpted interviews include the following past guests, in chronological order:THE BEST OF THE RRP – 2013For show notes and to learn more about these guests, click the corresponding episode hyperlinks, above.  Also, we didn’t want to include too much from very recent shows (even though some of them have been incredibly popular), as they are still so fresh.  For this reason, and because we have so many new subscribers who most likely have only listened to the most recent shows, we decided to focus on the early guests.If you’re miffed because I left your personal favorite out, I get it.  So many amazing guests over the year it was almost impossible to make a selection — it’s like trying to figure out who’s going to be your groomsmen at your wedding.  But we had to pick 10.  Not the definitive last word on the best of the best by any means – just good mix nonetheless.If you’re brand spanking new to the show, this should give you a really good feel for what we’re all about here at the RRP.If you enjoy this assemblage and would like another such episode, let me know in the comments below — if the demand is there, we’ll do another one.  Also, give Tyler a high five in the comments.  He worked his butt off on this one!NOTE: I am currently overseas in Casablanca, Morocco (the thumbnail episode image above was taken on this morning’s run here, the historical Hassan Mosque in the background).  I brought all my fancy podcast gear with me, but this morning when I plugged in my mixing board with my international power converter, it made a loud “pop” noise, started to smoke, then everything went black – something about the difference in voltage here I suppose.  In any event, my gear fried, this compelled me to record the show introduction and interstitial intros on my iPhone voice recorder – hence the poor audio on those clips.  More important to me to get the show up and out rather than wait until I can get my hands on a new board.  So the audio will have to do.  In addition, many of the excerpted interviews are from very early on in the show’s history — a time when I knew far less about how to properly record than I do now (not that I currently DO know what I am doing — for the most part I still have no idea what I’m doing).  Anyway, I hope you don’t find it too distracting.  And go easy on me.  I’m sensitive like that.That said, enjoy the show!HOW CAN I SUPPORT THE PODCAST?1.

December 2, 2013

This interview is like nothing you have heard before on this show.It will move you.  It will inspire you.  It will erase whatever obstacles and excuses you rely on that perpetuate bad habits, keep you stuck, and reinforce denial.  By listening, my hope is that you will realize that no matter what your circumstances or environment, we all have the power to implement profound personal change beyond our collective imagination in miraculous and fantastic ways.A couple weeks ago, a guy called Josh LaJaunie tweeted me his before and after pictures, thanking me for helping him along his journey of total transformation.  Bear in mind, I get many such images sent to me.  I absolutely love this stuff – It’s why I do what I do.  But something about this post was different.  The change was so astounding, my first thought was, “Can this be real?”  The 400+ pound guy on the left bore almost no resemblance to the guy on the right, a super fit, super handsome young man running with a big smile on his face.  And yet when I looked closely, I could indeed determine that it was in fact the same person.  I was stunned.Chris Farley had morphed into Bradley Cooper.  But how?I had to find out.  I reached out to him, and we exchanged a few e-mails.  Then he sent me a document, with a title that says it all.“FREE JOSH LAJAUNIE”A manifesto on life transformation, it’s the detailed personal account of how Josh accomplished what some would deem impossible, dropping over 200 pounds and a life-long addiction to unhealthy foods & lifestyle habits to discover a passion for running.  A journey that led him to completing a half-marathon and preparing for his first marathon.  He didn’t just lose weight — he became an athlete.But what truly struck me wasn’t just the weight loss or his discovered passion for running.  It was the story of how he faced, battled and overcame astounding, impossibly entrenched cultural obstacles to change everything about how he lives his life.  A gift he now freely shares, transforming the lives not just of his family members, but his beloved community at large.  At that moment, I knew I needed to share his story with you.Josh LaJaunie in 2007 — “I am an unabashed WHO DAT!”Born & bred in southern Louisiana, Josh is a 100% genuine, authentic, self-avowed “swamp dweller” from Bayou Lafourche.  Someone who shirks at the label “cajun” as too highfalutin, and “proud to sound like a coonass”.  A big kid surrounded by a loving nuclear and extended family united by their shared love of food — a regional imperative — Josh was a standout high school football player, recruited to play college ball.  But disillusioned by college life in Arkansas, he dropped out of school, only to return home, aimless and unmoored.  He found work in the family construction business, but lived for the weekend – time spent hunting, fishing, cheering for his beloved New Orleans Saints, feasting on his favorite local delicacies — po boys, jambalaya & barbeque.  And partying.  Lots of partying.  It’s just what you do down in Bayou Lafourche.The weight escalated.  As did the despair.  His embarrassment and shame escalating in equal measure to his declining self-esteem.  Not to mention an almost certain future of diabetes and heart disease.Then something happened.  In 2010, Josh’s beloved Saints achieved the impossible, winning the Super Bowl.  It seems a small thing.  But to Josh it was everything.  Forever altering his perception of what is possible, he began to question the limits he imposed upon himself.  Empowered, he began to “let go of his normal” and dismiss the embedded “that’s just the way it is down here” mentality he was starting to understand often taints the logic of his region.A chain reaction of events ensued that set Josh on a new trajectory.  A path that involved a return to fitness and the adoption of a 100% plant-based,  PlantPowered diet.  A path that changed his life beyond his imagination.A life transformed.It’s one thing to “go vegan” in Santa Monica, California.  But it’s another thing entirely in Thibodaux, Louisiana.  No plant-friendly restaurants.  No Whole Foods Market.  And essentially zero community support.  An environment where unhealthy food isn’t just a choice, but a celebrated cultural imperative.  Some might even say a religion.That Josh cut against the grain is an understatement.  To embrace a PlantPower lifestyle didn’t just mean an open invitation to ridicule.  It meant risking complete social ostracization.So just how did he do it? I won’t spoil the story entirely — you will have to listen to find out — but I will leave you with the final words of his testimonial:“I want to be a voice, an example of the worst offender fixing the wrong. I want to share my story…”I am proud to give Josh a well-deserved microphone to serve this end.  And I assure you that his extraordinary tale is well worth your precious time.  So put those earbuds to work and get to listening to this true American original.I hope you enjoy the conversation!P.S. – If you are interested in learning more about eating the PlantPower way, or looking for a unique gift for a fellow wellness warrior, our “Ultimate Guide to Plant-Based Nutrition”  is currently ON SALE for 30% off through the end of today, Monday December 2, 2013.  With over 3.5 hours of streaming video content, an online community forum and tons of downloadable resource tools, tips & recipes (including our e-cookbook), it’s everything you need to get more plants into your life.   To learn more and to purchase or gift, visit MindBodyGreen.com.SHOW NOTESHOW CAN I SUPPORT THE PODCAST?1.

November 25, 2013

Sometimes I feel like some kind of fringe conspiracy theorist.  I didn’t used to be this way, I promise.  But the more I delve into how things work — truly work — the more amazed I am by what I discover.I don’t care if you are vegan, locavore, pescatarian, paleo, primal, high-carb, low-carb, or slow-carb.  Everyone deserves to be optimally informed when it comes to how our food is harvested, distributed and marketed.  And yet, quite unfortunately, most consumers lack even a basic awareness of the dynamics at play, let alone a working understanding of the formidable economic protocols that function behind the production of meat, fish, eggs, and dairy.It is incumbent upon all of us to take personal responsibility for educating ourselves about the economic machinations that dominate and drive our food system.  Why? Because these forces affect all of us, irrespective of dietary preference.  And because informed choice is power. Today on the show I am pleased to introduce David Robinson Simon, attorney, advocate for sustainable consumption, and author of the newly released  Meatonomics*  — an important, groundbreaking and astoundingly revelatory deep dive into the potent economic, marketing, regulatory & legislative forces that support the meat and dairy industries’ masterful ability to influence and downright undermine informed consumer awareness and decision making when it comes to what — and how much — to eat.David’s thesis is that such consumer decisions aren’t just misplaced, but in fact manipulated and compelled — often on an unconscious level — by the behemoth animal food producers who effectively co-opt consumers’ buying choices with artificially-low prices fueled by out-of-whack farm subsidies; ubiquitous, powerful but misleading marketing campaigns; and heavy control over legislation and regulatory policy at the highest echelons of government.Over the course of our conversation, David provides vital insight into how the economics of institutional animal food production hold sway over our spending, eating, health, prosperity, economy, environment and longevity.  A perfect storm of almost conspiratorial circumstances that serve — in the macro — to exponentially increase (among other things):For a quick source-supported primer, check out David’s Meatonomics Index— 40 facts and figures that paint a picture of how our meat and dairy intake has spiraled out of control since 1935.Food for thought.Thanks for checking out this post and the episode, and I hope you enjoy the conversation.SHOW NOTESMeatonomics: How the Rigged Economics of Meat and Dairy Make You Consume Too Much-and How to Eat Better, Live Longer, and Spend Smarter* by David Robinson Simon (Conari Press, 2013)The Meatonomics Index: Numbers that Tell a StoryDavid Simon’s Website: MeatonomicsMeatonomics on FacebookDavid Simon on Twitter: @meatonomicsDavid Simon on FacebookThe China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted and the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss and Long-Term Health* by T.

November 18, 2013

If you know my story, you know it involves a descent into alcoholism, followed by a hard fought battle to achieve and maintain sobriety. Recovery saved my life, straight up, no exaggeration.  To this day it remains — and will always remain — my number one priority.I don’t talk it about it often on the podcast, but I think it’s an important subject to raise and discuss, particularly as we head into the holidays — an acutely perilous time for the millions who, alone, isolated and ashamed, privately battle these demons.Meet Khalil Rafati, founder of Sunlife Organics— friend, fellow recovery warrior and amazing living example of the profound resiliency of the human body, mind and spirit.  Not only has Khalil overcome unimaginable obstacles to survive, he has defied all odds and miraculously repaired his life wholesale.  A soul now devoted to the service of others, his primary focus on giving back what was so freely given him.Prepare to have your mind blown.Khalil’s tale is nothing short of astounding.  From the depths of absolute despair, homeless & hopelessly gripped by heroin addiction, Khalil was hell bent on dying.  And yet somehow, by way of a grace outside himself, Khalil came out the other side.  Not just intact, but repaired.  He didn’t just find sobriety.  He found his true life purpose.Today I am so proud to share my friend’s journey.  Behind all the raw intensity and earnest honesty and vulnerability, it is a story I think we can all celebrate.  A story of the impossible.  And at its heart, the story of true redemptive power of the human condition.Open your mind and heart and let Khalil inspire you.  I can guarantee that after listening to this profound and at times extremely intense conversation, you will understand that all the illusory excuses that imprison and prevent you from growth, health and self-actualization will seem trivial.For those that are suffering, this one’s for you.  Please know that all is not lost.  There is a solution. And there is hope.  Always hope.NOTE: In addition to the extreme intensity of the subject matter discussed, this episode also contains a few instances of explicit language.  So if you’re listening with the wee ones or at work, pop in the ear buds.  Nothing to crazy, just a head’s up for the more sensitive members of the audience. And should you find yourself in Los Angeles, do me a solid.  Drop by one of Khalil’s Sunlife Organics juice bars (on Pt. Dume in Malibu and in Thousand Oaks at The Lakes), order a green juice (or the Wolverine smoothie — my favorite) and give Khalil a high five.I sincerely hope you enjoy the show.  I’m really proud of this one.HOW CAN I SUPPORT THE PODCAST?1.

I’ve got news for you people.  Like it or not, the holiday season is upon us.That special time of year when we tend to overeat, overspend and simply overindulge in everything across the board, all in the name of celebratory merriment.  When we’re not charging it on the card or spread paper thin desperately trying to fulfill all the expectations presented, we find ourselves weathering an unnatural battery of social engagements, not to mention the myriad of emotionally hyper-charged landmines presented by extended family get togethers.The result?  A massive and unnatural outpouring of energy that leaves us utterly depleted — spit out the other side physically and emotionally exhausted to the core, all too often overweight and riddled with unnecessary debt.What if we could approach and experience the holiday season differently?  What if we could revel in the pure joy of the season and emerge in January not just intact but truly enriched — optimistic, feeling great and energized for all the challenges and adventures presented with the birth of a new year?Today on the show, Julie and I sit down to hash out all things holiday season with a focus on providing helpful, experience-based strategies to assist in managing the financial pitfalls, dietary challenges, precarious social environments and heightened emotional states presented by this unique time of year.  In my experience, these are issues common to us all.  And yet issues we go to great lengths to avoid dealing with internally, let alone discussing outwardly — typically out of fear, shame or simply a profound need to keep up appearances — all of which ultimately leaves us feeling alone and isolated in what for many can become a state of true emotional crisis.  In truth, the exact opposite of what the holidays should be all about.So rather than deny or repress, let’s talk about it.  Get it all out in the open.  And work on a strategy for a different, positive and uplifting experience.  On today’s agenda:In honor of this week’s episode and the commencement of the holiday season, we will be publishing a new post each day over the next several days, including the below listed holiday recipes discussed in our conversation.So make sure you continue to drop in throughout the week for the good stuff.  Here’s the schedule:We hope you enjoy the show!Photo Credit: Maclay HeriotPodcast Piano Composition: Tyler PiattHOW CAN I SUPPORT THE PODCAST?1.

For fans of Ben Greenfield, this is Ben like you’ve never heard him before.For longtime listeners and fans of health & fitness podcasts, Ben Greenfield needs no introduction.  Self-avowed training guinea pig, ardent nutrition student, accomplished multisport athlete, podcast host, blogger and health entrepreneur at Ben Greenfield Fitness  and all around good dude.Ben and I have been acquainted for some years — but only through the internet.  He was an early guest on this show ( RRP #11 ), I have guested on his podcast as well as his Endurance Planet podcast ( HERE ), we did a nutrition-oriented Spreecast with Vinnie Tortorich back in February ( HERE ) and he has written about my exploits a bit as well ( HERE ).And yet surprisingly, we had never met in person.  So it was a pleasure to finally sit down with the guy one-on-one so we could dig a bit deeper.  Skype interviews are great, but there is just no substitute for sitting across from someone when you want to have a proper chat.  And this interview gets it done in spades.Today on the show we talk about a multitude of things, including:Like many of my guests, I don’t agree with all points & issues raised.  But I truly like and respect Ben, particularly his willingness to engage in all forms of self-experimentation and his transparency when it comes to openly sharing his results.I hope you enjoy the conversation!SHOW NOTESFinally – dig the music cues and intro/outro clips on the show?

October 29, 2013

After listening to this interview, you will never again rely on advancing age as an excuse for anything.Meet the unique force of nature known as  Deborah Szekely  — in so many ways, the Godmother of the Wellness Revolution, but also a tireless activist, philanthropist, writer, and friend of Presidents and Hollywood elite.  At 91 years young, Deborah exudes the energy of someone 60 years her junior.  In fact, I have met few people in my life that could match the drive, vision, commitment and boundless vitality she persistently demonstrates when it comes to improving the health and wellness of people across the globe.Let me paint the picture.  Without Deborah, there is no Jack LaLanne.  No 24-Hour Fitness, Gold’s Gym, Equinox or Soul Cycle, let alone Canyon Ranch or Burke Williams day spas.  In many ways, so much of what we take for granted as part of our daily health and fitness lifestyle experience can be specifically tracked back to the work Deborah and her husband Edmond started in the tiny village of Tecate, Mexico in 1940.Hailing from Brooklyn by way of Eastern Europe, Deborah’s mother was a progressive raw foodist fruitarian and vice president of the New York Vegetarian Society.  When the Great Depression hit, Deborah’s garment business father moved the family to Tahiti, the land of abundant fruit, to live closer to nature — and persistently ahead of the curve.  It’s there that they met Edmond Szekely, a prophetic, highly educated and charismatic professor and author of Hungarian origin (then Transylvania) & Jewish heritage prone to long pontifications on the virtues of living in close connection with one’s natural environment.In her late teens, Deborah became Edmond’s secretary and ultimately his bride.  They later settled in Los Angeles, but with World War II on the horizon and Edmond fearing deportation back to Eastern Europe due to citizenship issues, they decamped to Tecate, about an hour’s drive from San Diego just over the Mexican border.Domiciled in a tiny cabin on a vast parcel of land at the base of a gorgeous mountain, in 1940 Edmond and Deborah opened their doors to the outside world — a summer camp they called Rancho La Puerta  where visitors could convene for $17.50 per week, provided they brought their own tent.  During the summer months, Edmond would lecture to groups on a number of topics, including the philosophy of The Essenes ; something he dubbed Biogenic Living; the ills of smoking (revolutionary at the time); and the virtues of a healthy diet, exercise and living close to nature.Bear in mind, this was decades before any of these subjects were in vogue.  Not to beat a dead horse, but to say Edmond and Deborah were a step ahead is an understatement.Not enough? In his downtime, Edmond wrote books — over 80 titles all told — and printed them with his own printing press.Word got out about the interesting happenings of Rancho La Puerta.  Hollywood took notice, and soon people like Burt Lancaster, Kim Novak, William Holden, and even Aldous Huxley could be found spending time at the Ranch.  The Ranch quickly grew, and in later years, Rancho has hosted the likes of Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, Barbara Streisand, Martha Stewart and Arianna Huffington.The rest is history.  In it’s 73rd year, Rancho La Puerta set the stage for every wellness trend, spa and movement that would follow.  Today the center boasts some of the best wellness programs, most beautiful facilities, finest food and appointed terrain in the world, attracting a vast and loyal global following of repeat clientele.Still not enough? Deborah ran for Congress.  Although she didn’t win, she still found herself in Washington, D.C. for 17 years as President of the  Inter-American Foundation  (IAF), an independent foreign assistance agency of the United States government which furthers grassroots development by awarding grants directly to the organized poor in Latin America, Caribbean, and the groups that support their efforts.And yet she still is far from done.  At 91, her latest of many passion projects is growing a 501(c)(4) health and wellness focused Super PAC lobbying group to confront and combat big food, agricultural and pharmaceutical companies at the federal and state legislative level — a project she founded called  Wellness Warrior.All told, it’s almost impossible to underestimate the impact Deborah has had on the wellness movement.  We all owe her an incredible debt of gratitude for the work to which she has devoted her life.  And it was an honor to spend a few hours getting to know her better during our recent stay at Rancho.I hope you enjoy the interview.NOTE: The audio for this interview is far from stellar.  Although I have worked out the production quality on the studio, I am still having some issues with my travel set up.  I apologize and hope it’s not overly distracting.  As always, I will continue to do better.Finally – enjoying the music cues on the show? Thanks my 18-year old son Tyler Piatt — not only did he produce and edit today’s show, he wrote, arranged and performed all the music as well.  Thanks Tyler!SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

Oprah Winfrey.  And Richard Branson.  Freaks of nature, right?  Once in a lifetime talents that deserve our reverence, but simply cannot be emulated, let alone replicated.We all want this right?  And yet it seems so elusive.  A struggle that can seem impossible for the average Joe to realize.  Why?Well. according to Dr. Spencer, this is because we lack one simple thing — a proper roadmap.  In other words, beyond sheer talent there’s a distinct, consistent method behind the innate gifts of the heroes we are so quick to worship that leads inextricably to achievement and keeps them on top.  A method that indeed can be identified and repeated in everyone’s life.  A method that can set you up for long-term success in not only the goal you seek, but more importantly the legacy that is your life.Born from the pain he experienced watching his genius artist father die homeless, his work unrecognized, Dr. Spencer began to ask himself: why did this happen, and how can I help others avoid this peril?  Informed by his prolific athletic career as a member of the 1972 US Olympic Team in track cycling and buttressed by his copious experience mentoring world class athletes as a 9-time Tour De France team doctor (chiropractor), Jeff came to truly understand and appreciate that no person succeeds without proper mentors and a supportive team.  Thus he began to identify patterns of predictable human behavior, and how certain predictable behaviors can indeed be harnessed to achieve previously unimaginable heights of achievement.  In turn, this ultimately led him to identify the 7 steps of what would become the foundation of The Champions Blueprint protocol – a curriculum he has used to help many achieve unparalleled, sustained legacy-worthy success.  Here are those steps, which we discuss at length in today’s episode:I am very proud of this conversation.  Surely, one of my favorite interviews to date, and an exchange that becomes quite emotional at times. An episode worthy of more than one listen.Thank you Jeff for showing up and demonstrating the courage to be vulnerable.  Wallow in the wisdom people!Finally – enjoying the music cues on the show? Thanks my 18-year old son Tyler Piatt — not only did he produce and edit today’s show, he wrote, arranged and performed all the music as well.  Thanks Tyler!SHOW NOTESHOW CAN I SUPPORT THE PODCAST?1.

Let me be clear.  Just because you are vegan does not mean you are eating a healthy diet.Today Julie and I sit down with the wonderful Chef AJ to talk about the enormous difference between a simple “animal product free” diet and a whole food plant-based diet.I knew AJ was an amazing plant-based chef.  What I didn’t know was her inspiring story of personal transformation.  The story of an overweight, junk food vegan on the brink of serious health calamity who found salvation in the whole food plant-based lifestyle.Tune in and let her tell you how she overcame her food addictions to become the health advocate she is today.  Her responses might surprise you.AJ is a kick in the pants.  It was tons of fun chatting with her.  I sincerely hope you enjoy the interview.  And if you are in California and happen to stop in a Sharky’s restaurant, ask for the AJ Burrito!SHOW NOTESHOW CAN I SUPPORT THE PODCAST?1.

Now for something a little different.  Meet Adam Dole– a White House Presidential Innovation Fellow currently studying the various ways technology can improve our healthcare system.Adam leverages an expertise in human behavior and sociology to help technology improve lives.  A rare and specific skill set that landed him a coveted gig at NASA problem solving Mars mission human transport issues and subsequently led to various entrepreneurial stints at Silicon Valley start ups.  A developing interest in health and wellness then found Adam spearheading technology innovation for the Mayo Clinic, more specifically a project he conceptualized called  Blue Button  — a healthcare software application empowering consumer access to healthcare and medical record information.The White House took notice.  And before he knew it, Adam found himself in Washington as part of the prestigious Presidential Innovation Fellow program.  Under the direction of White House CTO Todd Park, Adam spends his days (at least before the government shutdown!) studying the intersection of technology and our health care system with the purpose of identifying opportunities for cooperative collaboration between healthcare executives, government bureaucrats and technology entrepreneurs to identify and execute systemic, functional healthcare improvements for the benefit of the consumer.Adam is an energetic and fun guy.  His enthusiasm and passion for his work is infectious.  Work that is and will improve lives – no question.  Adam gives me hope and optimism that we can conquer the challenges faced by healthcare.  I truly enjoyed our conversation and think you will too.For a really nice feel for where Adam is coming from, check out this piece he co-authored for Fast Company Magazine:  “Empathize Like A Doctor, Design Like An Entrepreneur”Now, put your earbuds in and enjoy the episode!SHOW NOTESHOW CAN I SUPPORT THE PODCAST?1.

October 4, 2013

All hail the running carrot!  Today on the show I’m joined by my pal Matt Frazier, the guy behind the wildly successful NoMeatAthlete.com— website, podcast and roadmap series of downloadable tools — an absolute go to resource chock-a-block with information for runners and triathletes of all abilities looking to take their athletic & nutrition game to the next level.Matt founded NoMeatAthlete in 2009, about the same time he went vegetarian. Six months later, Matt qualified for the Boston Marathon with a time of 3:09:59 at the Wineglass Marathon, over 100 minutes faster than his first marathon time seven years prior. In June 2010, Matt ran his first 50-mile ultramarathon, recently completed his first 100-mile race and has run several more ultras and marathons each year since.What’s great about Matt is his sincerity, authenticity, transparency and relatability.  He’s not a world-class athlete, just a friendly, smart and resourceful guy who started experimenting with running and diet and wanted to share what he was learning.  A site that started out as little more than a personal document of his experiment in food and fitness, NoMeatAthlete has morphed over the last few years into one of the web’s leading resources when it comes to information relating to the intersection of running and plant-based lifestyle.The best part? Matt is genuinely a really nice guy.  A guy you just want to see win.  Like Rudy — a comparison that will put a smile of irony on your face when you hear our parting words at the end of the interview.Now Matt has taken all he has learned, and synthesized it into a new Book: No Meat Athlete: Run on Plants and Discover Your Fittest, Fastest, Happiest Self*  — do yourself a favor and check it out.  Let’s support this guy!Finally – a note of thanks.  Just a few days ago we surpassed ONE MILLION DOWNLOADS of the podcast.  That’s right.  A cool million.  That just blows my mind wide open.  Does not compute.  Surreal.  It’s all because of you. So thank you – for everything.  There have been ups.  There have been downs.  And more recently, controversy (see comments on Episode 53 with Durianrider– holy smokes).  I appreciate you for sticking around.  I am truly humbled and more energized than ever to continue the mission.  So much great stuff to come.I hope you enjoy the show.SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

September 30, 2013

Ask and ye shall receive.  Today is Durianrider day on the podcast.  And he has a message for you:Carb the f$%@ up!Aka Harley Johnstone, “Durianrider” is a self-avowed health vigilante committed to increasing public awareness of the benefits of a high carbohydrate, low-fat whole food plant-based lifestyle.  A lifestyle modeled upon Doug Graham’s book The 80/10/10 Diet*, or what is more commonly referred to as fruitarian — a dietary protocol based predominantly upon eating copious amounts of fruit.  Let’s just say it’s not uncommon for Harley to proudly devour upwards of 70 bananas a day.In this regard, Harley is not alone.  Although still on the fringe in terms of mainstream awareness and popularity, the 80/10/10 program is one that is gaining popularity (check out my podcast interviews with Michael Arnstein and Mac Danzig for more).But what distinguishes Harley from fellow healthy lifestyle advocates is his unique, personal style.Outspoken and unequivocal, Harley doesn’t mince words.  At times acerbic, and often on the perimeter of completely outlandish, Harley is a lightning rod for controversy — a role he relishes.  Proponents of “fad diets” hawking unhealthy and unethical programs or snake oil products get called out.  Taken to the mat.  And on occasion, name-calling is involved.And don’t even get him started on how he feels about the currently über-popular low-carb / no-carb / ketosis-based diets pushing high protein and copious amounts of fat.His fans are passionate.  His critics equally so.But make no mistake — behind the larger-than-life personality, Harley is in many ways a regular guy leading a simple and active life, committed to helping people feel as good as he does, primarily via his YouTube channel.  A guy frustrated by all the confusing and misleading health, diet and fitness information penetrating the internet, he’s like Howard Beale (Peter Finch) in the 1976 movie “Network” screaming, “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take this anymore!”Durianrider may not be everyone’s cup of tea.  I get it.  So does he.  And he’s fine with that.  But regardless of any preconceived opinions you may harbor, I implore you to listen with an open mind.His message is powerful.  And for the record – I like the guy.I hope you enjoy the show!For some background on the Harley ethos, check out this short video: Why is Durianrider So Aggressive?SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

September 26, 2013

Ronnie Schildknecht may not be a household name.  But he should be.  Why? because nobody in history has logged a faster Ironman on the soil of this continent faster than Ronnie.  This is a guy who won Ironman Florida in 2011 in 7 hours and 59 minutes.  An Ironman in under 8 hours!Just how fast is that? After swimming 2.4 miles in the ocean in 51 minutes, imagine getting on your bike and riding 112 miles at an average pace of almost 26mph for 4 hours and 19 minutes straight.  Then imagine getting off your bike and running a steady 6 minute to 6:15 pace to clock a blazing 2:43 marathon.Not enough for you?  When Ronnie won Ironman Zurich this summer, he became the only athlete to have won a single Ironman race seven years in a row consecutively.Beyond his incomprehensible athletic achievements, Ronnie is a man of soft-spoken disposition and considerate nature.  A guy more comfortable letting others bask in the limelight while allowing his race results speak on his behalf.  Refreshing.What I found most compelling is how Ronnie’s training has evolved over the last few years to a protocol that dispenses with the knee-jerk conventional wisdom of high volume and places more emphasis on high intensity quality work; recovery; mental preparation & visualization; and a protracted taper beyond his previous comfort zone.Ronnie’s evolution into the elite athlete he is today has required developing a greater understanding of — and confidence in — what specifically works for him — irrespective of the opinions of others, recommended training protocols, or the flavor of the month diet or training plan.What works for him.  Powerful.  And simple.  Yet something that nonetheless can be so elusive and difficult to embrace.  For Ronnie, it didn’t come easy at first — his sub-par Kona performances since his blazing 4th place in 2008 attributable to overtraining and not listening to what his body was telling him.  Why? Because trusting one’s instincts can prove incredibly difficult without extreme personal confidence and practiced mental discipline.  A strong internal compass capable of muting the outside world.  Healthy boundaries.  And a profound sense of self.Whether you are an athlete yourself or just a fan, Ronnie’s message of personal responsibility and self-awareness is powerful — principles that transcend sport — applicable to life wherever you find yourself.And I have no doubt that after listening to this interview, like me you’ll be a Ronnie fan, ready to cheer him on to Ironman victory in Kona.I hope you enjoy the show.PS – Here’s a really nice video from Ironman.com profiling Ronnie in his lead up to winning his 7th consecutive Ironman Zurich.

The lovely and powerful  Julie Piatt— my sometime co-host and all-time wife — returns to the show today to share some interesting perspectives on children’s education — more specifically, homeschooling.  And even more specifically, the Unschooling method of homeschooling.I know.  It’s controversial.  I get it.  But the subject also brings to mind one of my favorite quotes from one of the brightest minds of Victorian England – scientist, philosopher and theologian Herbert Spencer.  It appears in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous, and goes like this:“There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance — that principle is contempt prior to investigation.”Translation – listen with an open mind.  Because growth, change and expansion cannot occur without doing so.Other topics on today’s episode agenda include:My recent speaking engagements in Toronto and Tucson ;My increased involvement in an exciting new documentary project entitled Game Changers  about plant-based athletes, currently in production — produced by former podcast guest James Wilks ( Episode 16 ) and some of the people that brought you Forks Over Knives ;Witnessing  Patrik Baboumian’s world record-setting strongman lift & carry in Toronto;My impending visits to Karachi, Bahrain and Casablanca to spread the PlantPower message;Creating a PlantPower Halloween Movement; andBeyond Meat’s quest to disrupt Big Food with its perfect plant-based chicken and beef alternatives.During our conversation, Julie references Sir Ken Robinson and his opinions about our education system.  I can’t urge you strongly enough to take a few minutes to watch his powerful TED Talk on how schools kill creativity.  There is a reason it’s the most watched TED Talk of all time (almost 18 million views), so please take the time to open your mind to this:And here’s my view through my trusty GoPro of Vegan Strongman Patrik Baboumian carrying 1216 pounds for 10 meters, breaking a Guinness Book of World Record for most weight ever lifted by a human being – ever.

September 19, 2013

Today on the show I have the great pleasure of conversing with Dr. Garth Davis — a veteran weight loss surgeon who took it upon himself to determine exactly why so many people are plagued by obesity; a quest that led him down a deep research hole to identify the ultimate human diet to maximize health — both for himself and his patients.About 6 years ago, the good doctor became his own patient.  At the time, he was suffering from high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and a fatty liver.  In short, he was pretty sick.  Not surprising given the demanding hours of the surgeon lifestyle, lack of exercise, a preference for salty, fatty foods, and the convenience of fast food options in the hospital cafeteria.  In fact, there was a Wendy’s in the University of Michigan hospital where Garth did his internship and residency, resulting in a daily dose of  double cheeseburgers – a habit he maintained for years.Let’s just say that I can relate.Conventional dogma in his field is that overweight patients should eat nothing but protein — hop on board the low carb ketosis bandwagon. Without inquiring further, Garth simply bought into this idea as truth.  He even wrote a book in 2007 advocating this approach to food, called The Experts Guide To Weight Loss Surgery*.The only problem?  This approach to diet failed him and many other friends, colleagues and patients.  He knew there had to be a better solution.  And his patients needed help beyond knee-jerk surgery.  Finally ready for a personal change, he took it upon himself to research — truly research — nutrition for the first time, quite ironically given his profession as a weight loss surgeon.  Astoundingly, nutrition just wasn’t on the medical school curriculum, and almost never came up as all that relevant in the countless weight loss surgery symposiums he regularly attended.His inquiry went deep.  And the more he delved into the peer reviewed research, the more convinced he became that there is absolutely no science to back the long-term health claims surrounding the strongly held belief that if we want to be thin and healthy we should eat a high protein low carbohydrate diet.What did he find?  First and foremost, that Western Medicine has been failing us when it comes to the most crucial aspect of maintaining health — nutrition.  And that if we want to achieve ideal weight management, optimal health and long-term wellness, we need to turn conventional wisdom on it’s head and embrace the idea that humans are herbivores.  That’s right.  Herbivores.  Sound far-fetched?  Before you balk, understand that adopting this way of eating absolutely revolutionized Garth’s health beyond what he could have imagined.  Not only did he drop the weight that plagued him for years, all of his blood markers suddenly and quite magically normalized.  His allergies vanished.  His sleep improved, his energy levels skyrocketed and he got off his statin medications.  In short, he finally began to walk his talk.  As his life began to turn around, he wanted to be an example to his patients.  For the first time in his life, he began exercising.Then he did the extraordinary.  Despite never having been an athlete, in 2011 he nonetheless completed Ironman Texas in 12 hours and 6 minutes.His personal results nothing short of extraordinary, Garth has now become somewhat of a crusader to teach people real nutrition.  How to read scientific literature, and how the internet pseudo-experts are manipulating the science to push high protein diet.  And now he’s in the midst of writing a book on the subject.  The Protein Obsession* (Harper Collins / Harper One) should be out next year.Dr. Davis’ opinions on the paleo diet and the low carb diet craze are outspoken and unequivocal.  And don’t get him started on the trendy idea that saturated fat isn’t the enemy and we should all be eating bacon for breakfast.  For his words on these subjects alone, this interview is a must-listen if you want the straight up truth about eating right.We are all capable of doing so much more than we think we can.  Let Dr. Davis inform and inspire your own journey.Enjoy the show!SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

Sure, you’ve seen him on shows like CSI and Gilmore Girls.  But today’s guest isn’t just another actor.  He can do some amazing things you can’t. Very specific things, albeit obscure. Like hold his breath for a full seven minutes. Or swim 218 meters underwater along the bottom of a pool without coming up for air — not a single breath.Welcome to the mind-blowing world of Freediving, explained through the lens of one of the best in the sport — Australian National Record Holding Champion Tanc Sade.One of the things I love about the podcast is the excuse to meet compelling people doing amazing things outside the mainstream — things I would ordinarily never come across in my daily life and yet find utterly compelling.  Freediving certainly fits the bill — a sport that couldn’t be more different from endurance athletics and yet in certain respects still shares a commonality.Although the pursuit of excellence in any sport (as in life) require a strong mental game, Freediving requires unparallelled mental & emotional preparation. Learning to control the flexibility of not just your body or your thoughts but even your metabolic process through advanced meditation techniques.  Getting there is the fascinating part, and Tanc shows us how he does it, and why.And that’s just the beginning. No spoilers. Just sit back. Listen. And let Tanc blow your mind.In the interim — and to just paint the picture for you about what we are talking about here — have a look at Tanc’s 218-meter Australian national record-setting effort – an event called “Dynamic Apnea”:NOTE: Tanc is a professional. You are not. So no matter how inspired you may be by this interview, please DO NOT attempt your own half-baked unsupervised freediving experiment at home —  any type of breath hold work unsupervised can cause death. If you are interested in learning more about the sport, research freediving courses and/or clubs in your locale and undertake proper instruction from someone skilled in this discipline. And if you have additional questions, reach out Tanc on Facebook and he would be happy to advise and guide you in the right direction.PHOTO CREDITS: The trailer video thumbnail image of Tanc is by Mike Raabe.

Today on the show I chat with Thad Beatty, guitarist for the multi-platinum country duo Sugarland.In so many ways, Thad’s story closely mirrors mine.  The details are distinct, but no matter — the journey is all too familiar.  I first came across Thad’s story on Ironman.com and — struck by the similarities in our journeys — knew I had to have him on the show.Just a few years ago, Thad tipped the scales at 230 lbs.  Overweight with raging blood pressure and alarmingly elevated cholesterol, the touring musician lifestyle had him headed in the direction of irrevocable health problems in his mid-30’s.His decision to turn his life around snapped into focus the day he found out his mother had been diagnosed with colon cancer.  In support and solidarity with mom, both Thad and his brother decided to clean up their act.  It started simple — ditch the lousy processed foods and start eating more fruits & vegetables.  One thing led to another, and before he knew it, Thad found himself a convert to the PlantPower lifestyle.Not long thereafter, Thad shed the weight – 75lbs in all — down to a trim 165 lbs.  Life was good.  But then came another moment of clarity.  Sugarland’s guitar tech was diagnosed with advanced lymphoma.   MusiCares came to his aid, but it was too late.  Kevin Quigley unfortunately passed away in March 2012.It was at this moment that Thad decided to focus on service — giving back to his beloved profession.  So was borne his dream of completing an Ironman.  Not for himself, but to raise money for the foundation that had come to his friend’s aid.  Thad achieved his dream, finishing the Arizona Ironman last November, raising funds along the way.But that was just the beginning.  Thad decided to take his service game to the next level, ultimately establishing his own foundation — Music That Moves— dedicated to improving the holistic health and fitness of his fellow musicians beyond the stage through various means, including sharing the lifestyle principles that changed his own life.And this October he’s taking his game to the main stage — this time not as a musician but as an athlete — lining up in Kona to compete at the Ironman World Championships as part of Ironman’s Kona Inspired program.  I’m hoping we’ll all catch a glimpse of Thad and his story when NBC airs the race broadcast.I hope you enjoy the conversation!NOTE: There are audio quality issues with this Skype-recorded conversation.  Apologies.  Just when I think I have it all figured out, technology rears it’s ugly head once again.  The good news is the quality improves after the initial 30 minutes of the conversation.  I did my best to clean it up, but it is what it is.  As always, I promise to continually improve, but these things happen.  Go easy on me.Here’s a little video from Thad from the Kona Inspired site to get you pumped.SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

September 2, 2013

Today I sit down with the one and only Joe Cross, the man behind the wildly successful documentary film, Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead*. A few eerie parallels.  Joe and I are almost exactly the same age, and we both decided to make radical life changes when we turned 40. So when I began the journey I chronicle in Finding Ultra*, Joe began the journey he chronicles in his movie.  And now here we are, sitting across from each other, sharing our respective stories which essentially transpired concurrently.So what is Joe’s story?  100 pounds overweight, loaded up on prescription meds and suffering from a debilitating autoimmune disease, Joe was at the end of his rope — a 310lb man whose gut was bigger than a beach ball and a path laid out before him that wouldn’t end well.  With one foot already in the grave, the other wasn’t far behind.With doctors and conventional medicines unable to help long- term, Joe turned to the only option left, the body’s ability to heal itself. He trades in the junk food and hits the road with juicer and film crew in tow, vowing only to drink fresh fruit and vegetable juice for the next 60 days and see what happens. Across 3,000 miles Joe has one goal in mind: to get off his pills and achieve a balanced lifestyle.While talking to more than 500 Americans about food, health and longevity, it’s at a truck stop in Arizona where Joe meets a truck driver who suffers from the same rare condition. Phil Staples is morbidly obese weighing in at 429 lbs; a cheeseburger away from a heart-attack. As Joe is recovering his health, Phil begins his own epic journey to get well.Joe and I get into how Joe saved his life, helped create a populist movement around juicing and his plans for the future.Joe’s passion for health & self-healing is infectious — I hope you are inspired by his message to take your own wellness to the next level!SHOW NOTES:*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

August 26, 2013

Today I’m joined by my friend and (sometimes) summertime training partner Terenzo Bozzone – 5-time World Champion professional triathlete.I met “T” right after I completed EPIC5 back in 2010 when he arrived in town along with Chris McCormack for several weeks of intense spring training.  With a gracious poise and maturity well beyond his mere 28 years, Terenzo is one of the brightest stars in professional triathlon, as well as a remarkable ambassador of the sport — always quick with a kind word of encouragement to his fellow training partners and never too busy to connect on a personal level with his many fans.I’ve had the honor of getting to spend some quality training time with Terenzo over the last three years and will say this — the sport of triathlon is a better place with him in it.  T is one of the good guys.  A guy you want to see win.  A guy you can really get behind and root for.I’m so pleased that Terenzo took time out of his busy training schedule leading up to his peak race of the season — The Ironman 70.3 World Championships in Las Vegas just two weeks from today — to sit down and have a chat about his training, racing and life.I hope you enjoy the show. No doubt you’ll end up a big fan of all things Terenzo.  So do the guy a solid and let’s all show him some Twitter and facebook love to get him pumped for the big show in Vegas!Just a reminder that we’re now up and running on  Soundcloud  for those of you that prefer this service.  Check out the show there & follow us – I even created a few albums to help you find the episode and subject matter you are looking for, including a most popular episode album and episodes catalogued by subject matter – i.e., nutrition, fitness, entrepreneurs & spirituality.  Good stuff.  For those unfamiliar, Soundcloud is great because it allows you to share your favorite episodes across your social networks and even embed shows on your website or blog with their super groovy player widget.  You can even add comments to the show specifically tagged to the referenced section / time code.  And it’s an amazing tool to further help get the word out about the podcast, so we appreciate any sharing or spreading you are inclined to do!

August 22, 2013

Today on the show I sit down with my friend Mac Danzig, a fascinating PlantPowered force in the MMA / UFC world.Before we go any further, throw away any UFC fighter stereotypes that may come to mind.  Mac is one of the more intelligent, introspective and out-of-the box thinkers you are likely to meet — a personality and perspective forged from transcending a challenging upbringing to rise to the highest echelons of the UFC, including victory in Season 6 of the Ultimate Fighter  and a decorated career that includes twelve consecutive wins in 2006.Accomplishments all achieved on a 100% plant-based diet.I first met Mac a couple years ago and was immediately struck by his contemplative, low key personality.  A guy at peace with himself, far more comfortable alone in nature than navigating the spotlight.  A guy who really thinks about the authenticity of his actions, his place in the world, how to best father his daughter Nova, and the impact his decisions have on others and the planet at large.  So it was fascinating to finally sit down with him and hash it out.  Not short on opinions, Mac broke my record in episode length today, exceeding 3 hours and expounding upon everything from his career and diet (of course) to the benefits of meditation, the perils of our education system and sport as art.  Yeah, it’s a long one.  I know.  But I am really proud of this interview and essentially guarantee that you will be completely engaged throughout.It’s one thing when a triathlete, marathoner or an ultra-runner demonstrates plantpowered prowess.  We’ve seen that. But what about an athlete whose success depends upon brute strength, lightning speed, incredible power and world-class agility?  Well that’s another thing altogether.  Simply put, Mac’s success takes all the wind out of the tired argument that you cannot excel athletically on a plant-based diet.Now Mac is taking his game to a whole new level, experimenting with the 80/10/10 Diet – a regimen heralded by Douglas Graham in which 80% of all calories come from carbohydrates, 10% from protein and 10% from fat. Translation?  Most of what he eats is fruit — a protocol that stands in direct counterpoint to the high fashion, high fat, low carb craze currently in vogue.How is it working for Mac? You’ll have to listen to the whole episode to find out.  It might take a few sittings, but I promise it’s worth your time investment.I genuinely hope you enjoy the show.Just a reminder that we’re now up and running on  Soundcloud  for those of you that prefer this service.  Check out the show there & follow us – I even created a few albums to help you find the episode and subject matter you are looking for, including a most popular episode album and episodes catalogued by subject matter – i.e., nutrition, fitness, entrepreneurs & spirituality.  Good stuff.  For those unfamiliar, Soundcloud is great because it allows you to share your favorite episodes across your social networks and even embed shows on your website or blog with their super groovy player widget.  You can even add comments to the show specifically tagged to the referenced section / time code.  And it’s an amazing tool to further help get the word out about the podcast, so we appreciate any sharing or spreading you are inclined to do!

August 18, 2013

Today I delve deep with the magnificent and one and only Joel Kahn, M.D. to discuss the power of diet and lifestyle on heart health and long-term wellness.Joel calls himself an Interpreventional Cardiolgist. What is that? It means that he treats his patients with a blend of traditional interventional cardiology (stents) as well as preventive cardiology. It’s this rare combination that makes Dr. Kahn unique in his field.But let there be no mistake – Dr. Kahn is no new age hippie.  In additional to several post-doctorate certifications, he graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Michigan’s prestigious Inteflex program (a 6-year undergraduate / graduate program that developed doctors fresh out of high school) and has served as a Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at Wayne State University School of Medicine since 1993.In addition, Dr. Kahn has authored over 130 articles on heart disease, over 10 book chapters (as well as a new book due out in February 2014), and several monographs and video national presentations. He is a frequent lecturer on heart disease and its prevention. He has performed thousands of cardiac catheterizations and stent procedures and has been advising patients on heart healthy programs for over 20 years.In other words, Dr. Kahn knows what he is talking about.  And his message is powerful — if you want to experience true long-term wellness, then you must focus on implementing sustainable long-term preventive protocols into your lifestyle.  And this starts and ends with diet and active lifestyle.It was an honor to spend 90 minutes with Dr. Kahn, and his message is invaluable.  Simply put, the world would be a better place if we had more doctors like him.  So listen up people.Take his message to heart. Literally. And enjoy.Just a reminder that we’re now up and running on  Soundcloud  for those of you that prefer this service.  Check out the show there & follow us – I even created a few albums to help you find the episode and subject matter you are looking for, including a most popular episode album and episodes catalogued by subject matter – i.e., nutrition, fitness, entrepreneurs & spirituality.  Good stuff.  For those unfamiliar, Soundcloud is great because it allows you to share your favorite episodes across your social networks and even embed shows on your website or blog with their super groovy player widget.  You can even add comments to the show specifically tagged to the referenced section / time code.  And it’s an amazing tool to further help get the word out about the podcast, so we appreciate any sharing or spreading you are inclined to do!

August 13, 2013

Charlie Knoles is a visionary Vedic Meditation master teacher.  And today he joins Julie and I to de-mystify this ancient practice and demonstrate just how powerful implementing a simple and consistent meditation practice can be as an unparalleled tool for total life transformation.Having taught thousands — everyone from A-list celebrities, to Fortune 500 CEO’s, entrepreneurs, artists, teachers, nurses, athletes and underprivileged youth, Charlie has developed a unique expertise in distilling seemingly elusive and arcane Vedic traditions down to their essence so that the deepest concepts from spirituality and science may be expressed in simple, practical steps that are accessible, easily assimilated and, he would submit, absolutely necessary as a precedent to finding inner peace and happiness.Formally taught to meditate at age 4 by his father, the pre-eminent master (or “maharishi”) Vedic Meditation teacher Thom Knoles, Charlie followed in the footsteps of his father, developing a new curriculum for training meditation teachers and running deeply immersive courses in Vedic culture in the Himalayan mountains of India and on the northern coast of Bali. His background as a musician, his study of science and his experience as the father of three young children allow him to integrate many streams of knowledge and foster a deep understanding in his students.  Today Charlie and Thom together run The Veda Center.Julie and I first had the pleasure of meeting Charlie through our involvement with MindBodyGreen.  And what immediately struck me was just how grounded he is, particularly in comparison with other teachers I have encountered who tend to be, well let’s just say more “ethereal”.  No robes or holier than thou attitude, Charlie is very much a normal dude in the “world” — a husband, father of three young kids and even more of a photography and tech nerd than I am in fact.  It’s this relatable “normal guy” quality that distinguishes him and allows his vast knowledge to penetrate so many.  Hence countless lives forever transformed.Oh yeah – we’re now up on Soundcloud ! For those of you that prefer this service, check out the show there.  For those unfamiliar, Soundcloud is great because it allows you to share episodes across your social networks and even embed shows on your website or blog with their super groovy player widget.  You can even add comments to the show specifically tagged to the referenced section / time code.  And it’s an amazing tool to further help get the word out about the podcast, so we appreciate any sharing or spreading you are inclined to do! For more info, click HERE.Simultaneous with the launch of our Ultimate Guide to Plant-Based Nutrition, Charlie introduced his own MBG  online course, The Essential Guide to Meditation, which entails over 6 hours of video content (plus access to an online support community) specifically designed to teach you everything you need to know to learn and master meditation and mindfulness — irrespective of skill level.  Why? So you can access, develop and step in to your best, most actualized and authentic self — which you may know by now is my favorite subject, and the consistent theme of this podcast.I’ve studied his program and I can say with full confidence that he delivers, and then some.  This program is a more than worthy investment of your time and energy.  I can’t urge you enough to check it out.On a personal level, I will freely admit that my practice could improve in consistency and depth — I’m spotty at best.  Despite the fact that I know very well just how much better I feel and function physically, mentally and emotionally when I am meditating consistently, I nonetheless struggle when it comes to making it the priority it deserves.  But after this interview, I am newly inspired to take my practice to the next level.So I am publicly committing that for the next 90 days, I am going to meditate twice a day, every day, without fail.I’ll keep you posted on my results.  And I hope you will do the same.Enjoy the interview.NOTE: Poor Julie.  She had the unfortunate displeasure of having to use our lousy third microphone for this interview, which is why her voice comes off a bit muffled – apologies for the sound quality; it’s not her fault!  We are getting new equipment soon, including more top tier mics and recording equipment — all thanks to your support and donations.  Thank you!SHOW NOTESHOW CAN I SUPPORT THE PODCAST?1.

July 30, 2013

John Joseph is a true American original. John Joseph defines hardcore. John Joseph is a spiritual warrior. And he’s got a message for you.First, let me say that this episode is EXPLICIT. John simply can’t be edited or muzzled, and you wouldn’t want him that way anyway. He has a strong preference for four letter words. He drops the f-bomb about a thousand times during the interview and recounts in technicolor detail the horrific, grizzly reality of his abusive upbringing, his criminal background and past penchant for violence in the underbelly of Manhattan’s lower eat side in the 1970’s and ’80’s.So I’m saying it now — if you are easily offended, or this just isn’t your cup of tea, then this may not be the episode for you. That’s fine. Let’s just say this one just isn’t safe for the workplace.Disclaimer aside, I love this guy. It’s rare to meet someone so raw; real and authentic. Unafraid of life and certainly not shy when it comes to speaking his mind. And in this interview he lays his truth bare. With John, what you see and hear is exactly who he is. And his message — and life lessons — are amongst the most powerful I have ever heard.Conceived and raised in abuse. Deprived of opportunity. Left to his own devices. John turned to violence and drugs to make his way in the world. A path that led him to violence and crime — teen years spent as a drug mule; in and out of of foster care; and stints in juvi and jail. To avoid long-term incarceration, he enlisted in the Navy, only to go AWOL after a fight.Fleeing the law and rudderless, John found redemption in the hardcore punk rock scene flourishing on the lower east side of Manhattan in the 1970’s. And under the wing of Bad Brains’ frontman H.R. — a devotee of Rastafari — John began to explore not just his musicianship, but his spirituality as well. A journey that not only birthed the Cro-Mags — one of the most iconic and influential hardcore punk bands of the 70’s —  but led to life in a Hare Krishna monastery, where he found his spiritual salvation, developing his life-long love of meditation, yoga, sacred chanting, service to others — and a diet devoid of animal products.I’m not sure I have ever met anyone who has successfully transcended circumstances as horrific as his upbringing and lived to tell about it. And although John may have been educated on the streets, his spiritual acumen is legit — and vast. Make no mistake, this guys walks his walk. John is the true Thug Kitchen.During this conversation we tap into it all, culminating in his newfound love for triathlon. And how his deep connection to physical pursuit is a mere extension of his ongoing quest spiritual growth – something I can relate to entirely.I’m proud of this interview. And I’m proud to call John my friend. But again – this is a super intense conversation. Listen at your own risk. But I hope you do.UPDATE! We are now up and running on Soundcloud. What’s Soundcloud? Another platform to listen and share the podcast. What’s awesome is that it allows you to share the audio file across your social networks like Facebook and Pinterest and you can even embed this groovy player onto your website or blog.

July 20, 2013

Today on the show I sit down with my ultra running friend Josh Spector to talk all things Badwater.  Widely accepted as the “World’s Toughest Foot Race”, Badwater is a 135 mile running race across Death Valley — the hottest place on Earth, where temperatures average 120+ in July and can reach as high as 130 F with pavements temps typically in the 170-180 degree F range.Starting at Badwater Basin — the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below sea level, approxmately 100 invitation-only runners from across the globe begin a jaunt that will take them across bleak and scorching desert terrain as well as three formidable mountain passes, including the culminating 13-mile ascent up the portals of Mt. Whitney — the highest peak in the lower 48 — to finish at 8,300 feet.Yeah – it’s that insane.I had the honor & privilege of being a member of Dean Karnazes’ crew this year, along with Jason Koop, Brandon Friese and Nathan Peerbolt.  Together we paced, fed, hydrated and generally did all we could to help Dean complete this unbelievable race for the 10th time.  It was an extraordinary experience — one I won’t soon forget.Simultaneously, Josh — himself an accomplished ultra runner with three 100-milers under his belt — returned to Badwater for his third crewing experience, this time for runner Ray Sanchez.In this episode we swap stories about the experience, giving the listener a rare peek at exactly what it’s like to have a front row seat at what I have to say is one of the most incredible displays of the indomitable nature of the human spirit I have ever seen — and will likely ever see.Enjoy the show.To view a Flikr photo gallery of the journey click HERE— most images by Nathan Peerbolt with a few by Brandon Friese.  I took the GoPro pics.UPDATE! We are now up and running on  Soundcloud.  What’s Soundcloud?

My buddy Vinnie Tortorich — ultra-cyclist, celebrity trainer, fellow podcast host and now author — joins the show for a record 3rd appearance to talk about the release of his new book Fitness Confidential*.  Part memoir, part fitness primer and part comedy, this book is your beach read for July.  Vinnie and I don’t always see eye to eye on everything – particularly nutrition.  And he’s not everyone’s cup of tea.  But he’s still my man — we’ve gone through a lot together and he has always been there for me.I love that Vinnie calls it like he sees it, doesn’t pull punches and isn’t afraid to call BS — particularly when it comes to the latest health and/or nutrition fad.  If that appeals to you, then you’ll love the book.  It’s pure Vinnie, through and throughWriting a book is damn hard.  But what’s even harder is getting people to read it after you spent years of blood, sweat, tears and toil to get it right.  I’ve been there.  So the least I can do for my good friend is give him my microphone, let him tell you about the process first hand, and help him spread the word.I hope you enjoy the show!UPDATE! We are now up and running on  Soundcloud.  What’s Soundcloud?

I’m so excited to share with you today’s guest — my favorite female pro triathlete Hillary Biscay.  Why is she my favorite? Oh, let me count the ways….First we have similar backgrounds as collegiate swimmers (although I promised not to hold her USC affiliation against her). And not only is she on the PlantPower bandwagon (all the cool kids are doing it these days…), she is also the first guest I’ve had on the show who has also competed at Ultraman – it was great to hear her perspective on this race as a veteran pro.  So much to talk about, fresh off her 60th Ironman – yes you heard me right, 60 Ironmans! — which was also one of her fastest.  Finally, anyone who lists “running ultras” as her “hobby” away from triathlon is definitely on my wavelength.We get into all of it – what keeps her motivated; how her training has evolved from her days with legendary coach Brett Sutton to her current relationship with coach Siri Lindley; how she fuels her training and racing on plants (including missteps along the way); and of course her personal experience racing Ultraman, and what that was like as an ironman professional.Finally, we get to hear all about her new line of triathlon & active apparel – Smash.  You know I love good design, and this stuff is excellent.  I just wish she would hurry up and start making stuff for guys.Hillary is a delight, and she brings her vivaciousness to this interview in spades.  Enjoy.UPDATE! We are now up and running on  Soundcloud.  What’s Soundcloud?

Today on the show I sit down with Gene Baur — activist, best-selling author and president & co-founder of Farm Sanctuary, the first animal rescue organization dedicated to farmed animals.  You might have seen him in the documentary Forks Over Knives*.  And I’d be remiss in not mentioning his is a pretty darn good marathon runner prepping for his first Ironman this summer (on a plant-based diet of course).I’ve had plenty of vegans with strong points of view on the program.  But this was the first time I have interviewed a true animal rights activist.  I’m certainly not an expert in this area, but Gene is such a great guy, he made it easy.I’m the first to admit that my original reasons for going vegan were far more selfish than ethical.  But the more educated I become about how our food system functions to deliver meals to our plates, the more sensitive and attuned I have become to the indelible power of marketing; the extraordinary lengths to which BigFood and their adjuncts on Capitol Hill will go to keep the public immunized from the harsh realities of factory farming; and the unnecessary and horrific treatment of farm animals that inevitably results.Please understand — I take no moral high ground.  But as my awareness of this issue continues to broaden, I do feel a certain imperative to cast light on what I perceive as exceedingly cruel abuse on a systemic level.  In my very humble opinion, our current system is both untenable and unsustainable in the long term.  There is a better way.  And Gene is a great ambassador of a worthy message warranting our objective attention.If you come to this interview with a different perspective on this issue, I understand. And it’s fine. Believe me, I get it. I ask only one thing – that you please listen with an open and mind.Thanks.  And enjoy the show.UPDATE! We are now up and running on  Soundcloud.  What’s Soundcloud?

June 5, 2013

Today on the show I visit New York’s PS244 – The Active Learning Elementary School — in Flushing, Queens to chat with science teacher and Director of the school’s Wellness and Nutrition Program Christian Ledesma, as well as PS244’s Principal Bob Groff to find out how PS244 became the first public school in the United States to institute a vegetarian school lunch.But what I pleasantly discovered went well beyond a simple cafeteria upgrade.  PS244’s revolutionary school lunch program is just the latest manifestation of a school founded on principals of wellness.  It’s fair to say that the very fibre of PS244’s  DNA is the promotion of holistic health for kids premised on the advancement of not just the mind, but that of the childrens’ bodies & character.And it shows.  I saw food being grown in hanging gardens along the playground fences.  Kindergartners making their own granola bars and tasting blackberries in after-school programs.  Even a tower garden in the school library.  And that’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the day-to-day goings on at this special institute.What PS244 has accomplished — seemingly impossible within the confines of a very large & bureaucratic urban school district — is beyond inspiring.  And yet obviously doable when passion aligns with faith and hard work.  The bar is set.  And my hope is that this school’s example will empower other teachers, administrators, principals, parents and students to take greater initiative in their own schools and districts and aspire for positive change.Special thanks to Amie Hamlin, Executive Director of the New York Coalition for Healthy School Food.  It was her and this organization, working tirelessly for several years in alliance with the New York Department of Education, that made the impossible real.  My desire was to include Amie in this interview, but she was not in NYC on the day of my visit, so my plan is to interview her for a future podcast episode.  Stay tuned!Enjoy the show.Want to learn more about how they did it and/or get involved?

Not only is Roni Selig one of my favorite people, she is one busy woman, so I am honored that she carved out some quality time to sit down with me and do the podcast in the midst of her immersive (to put it mildly) work schedule at CNN, where she has the heady title of Director of the CNN Medical, Health & Wellness Unit in CNN’s New York City headquarters high above Columbus Circle.In certain respects, I suppose this makes her Sanjay Gupta’s boss — heavy, right?  To provide some perspective, we were meant to conduct this interview about a month ago.  But as we sat in her office catching up prior to potting the mics, the Boston Marathon bombing occurred, and I had the rare opportunity to watch her — and her team at the world’s leading 24-hour international news network — jump into action to begin covering the unbelievably tragic events as they unfolded in real time. It was impressive.  But needless to say, the horrible events of that day prevented the podcast from happening.  Lucky for me, I was back in NYC a month later.  No crazy breaking news that day, so we got it done.Compelling is the fact that despite the time constraints and pressures of her incredibly demanding job — amplified by her busy personal life as a wife and mother — Roni still manages to find the time to pursue her passion — triathlon — and pursue it well.We get into all aspects of her professional life — behind the scenes at CNN Health; plus how she balances her personal life to train and compete as a high level age group endurance athlete, and her passion for CNN Fit Nation — a program she oversees that involves a small group of civilians (hand selected annually from submissions) facing personal challenges committed to completing their first triathlon under the mentorship of CNN.All said, Roni is a delight and an inspiration.  I hope you enjoy the interview as much as I (always) enjoy spending time with her.FINDING ULTRA PAPERBACK IN TIME FOR FATHER’S DAYHey – you gotta get dear old dad something for Father’s Day, right?  Well, I have just the thing.   Finding Ultra* just hit bookstores and online retailers in paperback.  And it’s cheap – just $12.45 on Amazon*.  What the heck, right?  That’s like a one cold pressed juice at Whole Foods; and will hopefully be even a bit more nourishing.  Then tell a friend.As always, thank you for all the ongoing support.  You guys are everything.SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

Today on the podcast I sit down with Jason Wachob, co-founder and CEO of MindBodyGreen.com– the internet’s primary destination for all things wellness.I first crossed Jason’s path back in 2009 and we have been fast friends with him and his wife Colleen ever since.  I love his vision and am so excited to share his story — and that of MindBodyGreen — with you.Not only has Jason placed an indelible mark on the new media scene with his Dumbo, Brooklyn based startup, eclipsing expectations of what a web-based health-oriented content provider can and should be, his personal journey from overstressed Wall Street Trader — his face forever memorialized on the wall at The Palm – one of NYC’s most famous steak houses! — to Wellness Warrior / yoga & meditation evangelist is noteworthy in it’s own right and eminently relatable.Watch him recap his story briefly here:Then enjoy the show!THANK YOUJust yesterday we eclipsed half a million downloads of this podcast.  That’s over 500,000 listens – UNBELIEVABLE!  Thank you so much for tuning in.  It’s been a dream.  I started this podcast on a whim while living in yurts on an organic farm on the North Shore of Kauai this past winter.  It was merely an experiment.  A creative outlet.  I would never have predicted that it would have found such a large audience.  Thank you.  I am beyond grateful.  Beyond humbled.  And committed more than ever to raise the bar on this show and double down on quality.  That’s a promise.FINDING ULTRA PAPERBACK IN TIME FOR FATHER’S DAYLast week Finding Ultra* finally hit bookstores and online retailers in paperback. It’s an honor, as not every book published gets a paperback release.  So here I am again, pitching you with the hard sell.  It feels weird, but hey — I’m on my own here.  No publicist.  No press.  Plus, Random House basically told me they don’t have the resources to market and promote the release.  So I’m flying solo and need all the help I can get.But I’m not alone — I’ve got all of you, who have been beyond supportive.  So if you’ve enjoyed the content I’ve been freely sharing — content that takes an obscene amount of my time to create — and feel inclined to support the message I so passionately believe in, then this is the time I am REALLY ASKING FOR YOUR HELP.Already read the book?  Then get it as a gift for someone — after all, Father’s Day is coming up and you gotta get dear old dad something anyway.  Plus, it’s darn cheap – just $12.99 on Amazon! What the heck, right?  That’s like a one cold pressed juice at Whole Foods; and will hopefully be even a bit more nourishing.  Then tell a friend.THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.  SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

THE BEAST RETURNS!Once again, I’m switching gears.  The interviewer becomes the interviewee.  Part II.Mishka was a super popular guest on the podcast about a month ago.  If you listened to the interview, you know we went deep — exhaustingly deep perhaps.  Despite the fact that I had never previously met Mishka face-to-face, I had a knowing sense that we would hit it off given our many points in common – writing, running, alcoholism & sobriety.  There was an immediate short hand, and we just went straight to the core until we both felt like we were drowning in molten lava when the interview was over.So when my publisher raised the issue of having someone interview me to coincide with the release of the paperback version of Finding Ultra* — hitting bookshelves and online retailers  5/21! — I knew Mishka more than fit the bill.Osher Günsberg hit the nail on the head with Part I of this self-involved and shameless self-promotional podcast double, and Mishka picks right up with Part II right where Osher left off — repaying the favor of my unrepentant deep dive with him by hitting me hard with some tough questions as we peel back the layers and get behind the scenes on my book, my story and what drives both of us.OK.  NOW FOR THE (HOPEFULLY NOT TOO) HARD SELL…..I feel weird asking people to buy the paperback.  I’m sure the majority of you listeners out there have already read my book – you have, right?  RIGHT??  But then again, who knows?  Maybe you haven’t.  Maybe you just stumbled upon this blog and podcast out of the blue.  So here is an opportunity to learn a bit more about me, why I wrote the book and what I hoped to express.Oh yeah, there’s also this little matter of admitting that I would like to move some units.  Maybe even make the  NY Times Bestseller List for Non-Fiction Paperbacks  – a list I narrowly missed with the hardcover release.  OK, busted.  Call me shameless.  Call me competitive.  Or, just shoot me.  I am formally apologizing right here and right now.  But hey, wouldn’t you do the same if you had spent a couple years writing a book?  So cut me some slack.  I will say that if I do make the list — an admitted (huge?) longshot, it will be entirely due to YOU — the audience of this podcast and blog.  And hey, if my book and this podcast stand for anything, it’s that we should all dream big.  Making that list is definitely a big dream of mine.Moreover, the truth is, I ain’t got no publicist out there shilling for me.  Plus, Random House basically told me they don’t have the resources to market and promote the release — basically no press to get the word out.  So I’m on my own.  But I’m not — I’ve got all of you, who have been beyond supportive.  So if you’ve enjoyed the content I’ve been freely sharing — content that takes an obscene amount of my time to create — and feel inclined to support the message I so passionately believe in, then this is the time I am REALLY ASKING FOR YOUR HELP.Forget donating, just pull the trigger on the paperback.  Already read the book?  Then get it as a gift for someone — after all, Father’s Day is coming up and you gotta get dear old dad something anyway.  Plus, it’s darn cheap –  just $13.50 on Amazon.  What the heck, right?  That’s like a one cold pressed juice at Whole Foods; and will hopefully be even a bit more nourishing.  Then tell a friend.THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.  Enough self-promotion.  Enough!  Everything else aside, I think you will really enjoy my conversation with Mishka – one more brother from another mother.SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

Today we switch gears a bit.How?This time the interviewer becomes the interviewee.Why?  In just a few days (May 21st to be exact), the paperback version of Finding Ultra* hits bookstores — front table placement at Barnes & Noble! — or so I’ve been told….I’ll believe it when I see it — and online retailers.  It’s quite an honor that I am even getting a paperback release at all, and I want to make the most of the rare opportunity.  On that note, my publisher thought it might be fun to have someone interview me for a change.  Not to ask the same old questions I’m always asked, but to kind of go beyond the typical “Where do you get your protein?” line of inquiry and delve deeper.  I must admit I wasn’t to keen on the idea initially.  This podcast isn’t really about me, it’s about my guests; I’m just the host.Then again, if I could find the right person to do it — somebody who knows me quite well and has something to really bring to the equation — then maybe it could be cool.Who?Well I found the right guy.  Not only is Osher Günsberg a good friend, fellow plant-eater, marathon runner / aspiring ultra-runner and all-around cool dude, he’s also a professional host.  Those Down Under likely know this swarthy, handome and dynamic gentleman as ” Andrew G. ” — host of Australian Idol  (Australia’s version of American Idol) and from an array of other radio and television programs in both Australia and here in the U.S., including the CBS show Live To Dance, which he co-hosted with Paula Abdul.  In addition, he is a proud supporter of the Indigenous Marathon Project, which provides an opportunity for Indigenous men and women of Autralia to run the New York Marathon, which is not only inspiring but helps encourage healthy, active lifestyles.A long way of saying he is total pro.  And in this interview, it shows.Then there is this little matter of how — in the right light — we can appear to look somewhat similar.  Don’t believe me?  Check the Instagram I posted the other day — it’s over the top; although he is admittedly far more handsome and charming than I.  Dopplegänger Günsberg.  Forgive the phrase — I know it sounds like everyone’s favorite hair band.  I guess I just wanted to write two words in a row with a diaeresis.What For Again?I feel weird asking people to buy the paperback.  I’m sure the majority of you listeners out there have already read my book – you have, right?  RIGHT??  But then again, who knows?  Maybe you haven’t.  Maybe you just stumbled upon this blog and podcast out of the blue.  So here is an opportunity to learn a bit more about me, why I wrote the book and what I hoped to express.Oh yeah, there’s also this little matter of admitting that I would like to move some units.  Maybe even make the NY Times Bestseller List for Non-Fiction Paperbacks– a list I narrowly missed with the hardcover release.  OK, busted.  Call me shameless.  Call me competitive.  Or, just shoot me.  I am formally apologizing right here and right now.  But hey, wouldn’t you do the same if you had spent a couple years writing a book?  So cut me some slack.  I will say that if I do make the list — an admitted (huge?) longshot, it will be entirely due to YOU — the audience of this podcast and blog.  And hey, if my book and this podcast stand for anything, it’s that we should all dream big.  Making that list is definitely a big dream of mine.Moreover, the truth is, I ain’t got no publicist out there shilling for me.  Plus, Random House basically told me they don’t have the resources to market and promote the release — basically no press to get the word out.  So I’m on my own.  But I’m not — I’ve got all of you, who have been beyond supportive.  So if you’ve enjoyed the content I’ve been freely sharing — content that takes an obscene amount of my time to create — and feel inclined to support the message I so passionately believe in, then this is the time I am REALLY ASKING FOR YOUR HELP.Forget donating, just pull the trigger on the paperback.  Already read the book?  Then get it as a gift for someone — after all, Father’s Day is coming up and you gotta get dear old dad something anyway.  Plus, it’s darn cheap – just $13.50 on Amazon.  What the heck, right?  That’s like a one cold pressed juice at Whole Foods; and will hopefully be even a bit more nourishing.  Then tell a friend.THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.  Enough self-promotion.  Everything else aside, I think you will really enjoy my conversation with Osher.  He’s the man.SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

Today on the show I welcome nutritionist and dietitian Andy Bellatti MS, RD.  Sure we talk plant-based and other issues related to optimal nutrition (hint: eat REAL FOOD!).But what makes Andy unique amongst his peers isn’t so much his pro-plant bias as it is his passion for calling out the inextricable link between giant food corporations and how we innately come to think and feel about the foods we (often unconsciously choose to) eat.From congressional legislation to school lunch policy, the food pyramid and what we are actually led to believe we need to live and thrive is in more ways than you would imagine completely dictated by these corporations, their lobbying efforts and Madison Avenue advertising agencies.  What makes Andy different is his courage to take a stand on this issue and his tireless push for positive changes, both systemic and individual.Enjoy!SHOW NOTESOne more self-serving rant: the paperback version of  Finding Ultra*  is coming out on May 21.  Sure, that’s still a bit off in the distance, but it’s already up on Amazon.  Pre-order now by clicking  HERE*  and get it before it hits bookstores!Thanks for listening!*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

Today on the podcast we GO DEEP.In the short lifespan of this show, I’ve had the honor of interviewing a wide variety of incredible guests — paradigm busting thought leaders pushing the boundaries of conventional wisdom on a myriad of health & fitness related subject matters. But there is an elephant in the room.  I’ve been waiting for the right guest to get into the issue closest to my heart — addiction & recovery.If you read my book you know my story.  But I have been reluctant to use the podcast to discuss in depth the most integral part of my life & struggle.  I suppose I was waiting for the right guest for the job.  Someone equipped to handle this kind of discussion.  Somebody who understands.Well, I found him.  And when I say we go deep, I mean it’s intense.  Big love to Mishka for the willingness to be vulnerable; open and considered in his responses.  It takes courage to be so transparent, and he’s got it in spades.In many ways, our stories are vastly different.  And yet they are exactly the same.  Alcoholism, struggle, recovery, writing, ultrarunning, redemption.  My long lost brother.  My peer.  My comrade in arms in the battle against the demon that wants both of us — and untold millions — drunk, imprisoned, institutionalized, and eventually dead.Disclaimer: If you are stumbling onto this episode merely looking for training/nutrition tips, this interview might not be your cup of tea.  And if so, that’s fine.  But I also know for a fact that there are a lot of people out there that will glean insight and inspiration from Mishka’s redemptive journey.  All I can say is that I’m really proud of this interview.  And I hope you enjoy it.NOTE: there are a few moments of explicit language in case you are language sensitive.ANOTHER NOTE: The song used to bridge the intro to the interview? “The Only One Drinking Tonight,” by Mishka Shubaly from “How To Make A Bad Situation Worse”SHOW NOTESIf you like very good writing and quick easy reads, check out Mishka’s array of Kindle Singles.  Then thank me later.The Long Run*Shipwrecked*Bachelor Number One*Are You Lonesome Tonight?*Some other cool stuff from Mishka:Mishka on The Moth: “Shipwrecked”Mishka’s CNN iReport: “A Marathon for Boston”MishkaShubaly.comMishka on Twitter: @mishkashubalyMishka on FacebookOne more self-serving rant: the paperback version of  Finding Ultra*  is coming out on May 21.  Sure, that’s still a bit off in the distance, but it’s already up on Amazon.  Pre-order now by clicking  HERE*  and get it before it hits bookstores!Thanks for listening!*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

Today on the podcast I am very pleased to host ultra-running legend Michael Arnstein, aka “The Fruitarian”.  Why the nickname?  because this guy is killing it on foot at distances from 26.2 all the way to 100 miles and beyond, powered almost entirely by raw fruit.How is that even possible?  I thought I was extreme.  Tune in and find out.Beyond his amazing accomplishments on foot, Michael was also on site at the Bostin marathon finish line.  His first-hand account of this unspeakable horror is reason enough to give the show a listen  during this melancholy and difficult time.One more self-serving rant: the paperback version of  Finding Ultra* is coming out on May 21.  Sure, that’s still a bit off in the distance, but it’s already up on Amazon. Pre-order now by clicking HERE* and get it before it hits bookstores!Thanks for listening!SHOW NOTESMichael was far too humble to promote himself on the show, so I’m doing it for him.  For more info on how he gets it done, visit his website (below).  Also, he is the founder and host of the annual Woodstock Fruit Festival, being held this year on August 18-15 in Woodstock, NY.  Check it out — I’m going to try to make it myself.*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

I cannot tell you how excited I am to share today’s guest — a man who needs no introduction — triathlon legend Chris “Macca” McCormack.This interview is PURE GOLD!In case you’ve been living under a rock and have never heard of Macca, he is one of the winningest triathletes of all time, dominant at all distances from sprint to Ironman.  He is a two-time Ironman World Champion and victor in over 200 triathlon races, including 12 Ironman titles, the 1997 ITU World Cup Series and the 1997 Triathlon World Championships, to name just a few.If you are a fan of Macca, then you’ve probably heard more than a few of his more outspoken — but always entertaining — interviews.  I didn’t want to reap an over-plowed field, so I chose to instead focus on aspects of his life less well-known — how he handles the balance of training and family life; how turning 40 has impacted his always evolving perspective on training and racing; and how he is learning to leverage social media as a service tool to help better communicate with and educate his amateur athlete fan base.  case in point – check out his  MX12 Training Videos  by clicking  HERE.I am super proud of this episode — Chris could not have been more candid, engaging and fun.  I hope you enjoy the show as much as I enjoyed doing it!Speaking of enjoying the show — if you are, and inclined to help support what we are doing, then make sure you subscribe on iTunes and leave a comment on the  iTunes page for the show.Finally, proud to announce that the paperback version of Finding Ultra* is coming out on May 21.  Sure, that’s still a bit off in the distance, but it’s already up for pre-order on Amazon.  Pre-order now by clicking HERE* and get it before it hits bookstores!Thanks for listening!SHOW NOTES*Disclosure: Books and products denoted with an asterisk are hyperlinked to an affiliate program.

Life should be lived passionately.So says today’s guest Lewis Howes, and I couldn’t agree more.If you are immersed in the online marketing world, you’ve probably heard of Lewis — a former professional football player & renown pioneer lifestyle entrepreneur.  But in case you haven’t, let me introduce you to his universe.Lewis is a former two-sport All-American (football & decathlon) and current world record holding athlete (most yards received in a single football game), has graced lists such as Details Magazine’s “5 Internet Gurus Who Can Make You Rich” and Incomediary.com’s “50 Most Influential People in Blogging.” Most recently, Lewis was ranked as one of Genjuice.com’s top “100 Most Desirable Mentors” along with the likes of Barack Obama, Russell Simmons and the Queen of Jordan.In just three years, my man went from a depressed and aimless former professional Arena-league football player who’s career was cut short due to injury sleeping on his sister’s couch to running a seven figure business. He began his entrepreneurial career by hosting LinkedIn meetups around the country, and co-authoring the successful book LinkedWorking. He has hosted over 400 webinars, spoken to thousands at conferences and events, and educated career professionals and business owners around the world on the power of LinkedIn.Not enough?  He’s also a member of the U.S. National Team Handball squad.  He loves CrossFit too.  Don’t worry, we get into all of it.Oh yeah, he’s also the host of The School of Greatness Podcast, currently blowing up charts on iTunes.  I was honored to be a guest on his show a couple weeks back and am pleased that he joined me for an enlightening and inspiring chat about discovering, unlocking, and unleashing your best, most authentic self – my favorite subject.I hope you dig the show and end up as inspired as I was sitting down with him in person.Enjoying the podcast and want to support the show?

Colonics obsession, the joys & challenges of raising an autistic child & the impact of diet on spectrum behavior, the benefits of juicing, becoming a raw food chef, Natasha’s fitness & diet perpective, the importance of maintaining a healthy gut microbial ecology, vaccinations (uh oh!), the 10% Rule — Natasha’s primer for tackling & ultimately overcoming barriers to healthy eating habits & fitness practices — and of course the question everyone wants to know: what it’s like to train a big celebrity?TECHNICAL NOTE: As you will no doubt notice, there are some odd clicking sounds with Natasha’s microphone. Despite running some audio EQ, it nonetheless subsists.  Apologies in advance and as I keep saying (did I say I’m apologizing?), I’ll do better next time.  Or maybe it’s time to get a real producer involved – which by the way, is in the works…Enjoy the podcast and want to support the show?

In the debut episode of the Rich Roll Podcast, Rich converses with his wife Julie Piatt about life in Kauai, sustainable lifestyle, enhancing your personal creativity and homeschooling.Finally!I’ve been talking about doing a podcast for what seems like eons.  For whatever reason, I just couldn’t seem to get around to actually figuring out how to do it, let alone get it done.  But I finally found the time to sort through at least the initial barrier configuration issues and am happy to announce my virgin episode, which features my wife and (much) better half Julie Piatt.We are still sorting through some tech issues so it’s far from studio polished, aside from the killer intro / outro music courtesy of my very talented son Tyler and nephew Harrison!  The sound from this episode is admittedly a bit echo-y due to the warehouse recording environment– and I have yet to configure it for video and livestream broadcasting, which I am currently working on.  But rather than wait until I had everything perfect, I wanted to just begin.  Start slow and organically and let it grow as I find my voice and legs so to speak.  I’m far from a professional broadcaster, but I hope that through this effort I can bring some insights and interesting people to your ears that will both enlighten, provoke and entertain.First off – this is NOT a “triathlon training / coaching” styled podcast.  There are plenty of those out there already that are very well done ( Zen Triathlon and IMTalk are my faves for this), so if you are looking for a podcast that is very narrowly tailored to this specific subject and this subject only, then I fear my program may not be exactly what you are looking for.  And yet, I implore to nonetheless give it a trial run with an open mind (and ears).Instead, my plan is to provide a long-form discussion platform to raise and converse about a wide variety of subjects that interest me.  Certainly, triathlon, running, cycling, swimming, training, fitness in general and everything that goes into that is of course a subject that interests me dearly, so of course I will be programming helpful information in this regard.  But my focus will broaden from there into plant-based nutrition for the athlete and everyman (and woman); wellness in general; spirituality; yoga & meditation; and sustainable lifestyle.Most importantly, my desire is to create a platform to help lead the way to unlocking the best version of yourself.  How to live more authentically.  And thrive from the heart.I hope you enjoy this first episode.  Many more in the works and I hope to record at least 2 to 3 of these per week.I am very interested in your thoughts on the episode, comments in general and ideas for future episodes.  In the comments section below, PLEASE let me know what YOU think, would be interested in hearing me talk about in future episodes, people you would like me to interview, and anything else on your mind.  I’m wide open.Feel free to share.  In fact, if you enjoyed the piece I would love it if you could help spread the word.  You can even embed the audio player on your site as you wish.The podcast is now live on Stitcher (see widget below) and has been submitted to iTunes & Blackberry services and should be available for subscription and download on those various sometime in the next 48 hours, at which point I will update this post with the subscription links.NOTE: 11.29.12: The podcast is now live on iTunes HERE Thanks for listening and look forward to your thoughts.Peace + Plants!SHOW NOTES Common Ground  Julie on Twitter @jaiseed  Rich Facebook Fan Page (I’ve reached my max of 5K friends on my personal page, so if you tried to friend me there, it’s no bueno.  Instead, please “like” my Facebook Fan Page) SriMati Music Website  SriMati Music on iTunes  Jai Lifestyle  Jai Seed eCookbook  Jai Repair PlantPower Recovery Formula  Jai Release Meditation Program  Vitamix Free Shipping Link Next Sign up for Roll Call — my free weekly blast of instructive recommendations, resources, inspiration & podcast updates.
